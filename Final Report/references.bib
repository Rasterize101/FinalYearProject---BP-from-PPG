   abstract = {Objective: Continuous blood pressure (BP) provides valuable information for the disease management of patients with arrhythmias. The traditional intra-arterial method is too invasive for routine healthcare settings, whereas cuff-based devices are inferior in reliability and comfortable for long-term BP monitoring during arrhythmias. The study aimed to investigate an indirect method for continuous and cuff-less BP estimation based on electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals during arrhythmias and to test its reliability for the determination of BP using invasive BP (IBP) as reference. Methods: Thirty-five clinically stable patients (15 with ventricular arrhythmias and 20 with supraventricular arrhythmias) who had undergone radiofrequency ablation were enrolled in this study. Their ECG, PPG, and femoral arterial IBP signals were simultaneously recorded with a multi-parameter monitoring system. Fifteen features that have the potential ability in indicating beat-to-beat BP changes during arrhythmias were extracted from the ECG and PPG signals. Four machine learning algorithms, decision tree regression (DTR), support vector machine regression (SVR), adaptive boosting regression (AdaboostR), and random forest regression (RFR), were then implemented to develop the BP models. Results: The results showed that the mean value ± standard deviation of root mean square error for the estimated systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) with the RFR model against the reference in all patients were 5.87 ± 3.13 and 3.52 ± 1.38 mmHg, respectively, which achieved the best performance among all the models. Furthermore, the mean error ± standard deviation of error between the estimated SBP and DBP with the RFR model against the reference in all patients were −0.04 ± 6.11 and 0.11 ± 3.62 mmHg, respectively, which complied with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation and the British Hypertension Society (Grade A) standards. Conclusion: The results indicated that the utilization of ECG and PPG signals has the potential to enable cuff-less and continuous BP estimation in an indirect way for patients with arrhythmias.},

Blood pressure is a primary vital sign that must be monitored regularly for the early detection, prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Traditional blood pressure measurement techniques are either invasive or cuff-based, which are impractical, intermittent, and uncomfortable for patients. Over the past few decades, several indirect approaches using photoplethysmogram (PPG) have been investigated, namely, pulse transit time, pulse wave velocity, pulse arrival time and pulse wave analysis, in an effort to utilise PPG for estimating blood pressure. Recent advancements in signal processing techniques, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, have also opened up exciting new horizons for PPG-based cuff less and continuous monitoring of blood pressure. Such a device will have a significant and transformative impact in monitoring patients’ vital signs, especially those at risk of cardiovascular disease. This paper provides a comprehensive review for non-invasive cuff-less blood pressure estimation using the PPG approach along with their challenges and limitations.},

   abstract = {Background: Blood pressure (BP) measurements have been used widely in clinical and private environments. Recently, the use of ECG monitors has proliferated; however, they are not enabled with BP estimation. We have developed a method for BP estimation using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Methods: Raw ECG data are filtered and segmented, and, following this, a complexity analysis is performed for feature extraction. Then, a machine-learning method is applied, combining a stacking-based classification module and a regression module for building systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) predictive models. In addition, the method allows a probability distribution-based calibration to adapt the models to a particular user. Results: Using ECG recordings from 51 different subjects, 3129 30-s ECG segments are constructed, and seven features are extracted. Using a train-validation-test evaluation, the method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.64 mmHg for SBP, 18.20 mmHg for DBP, and 13.52 mmHg for the MAP prediction. When models are calibrated, the MAE decreases to 7.72 mmHg for SBP, 9.45 mmHg for DBP and 8.13 mmHg for MAP. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that, when a probability distribution-based calibration is used, the proposed method can achieve results close to those of a certified medical device for BP estimation.},

   abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) is one of the most important monitoring parameters in clinical medicine. For years, the cuff-based sphygmomanometer and the arterial invasive line have been the gold standards for care professionals to assess BP. During the past few decades, the wide spread of the oscillometry-based BP arm or wrist cuffs have made home-based BP assessment more convenient and accessible. However, the discontinuous nature, the inability to interface with mobile applications, the relative inaccuracy with movement, and the need for calibration have rendered those BP oscillometry devices inadequate for next-generation healthcare infrastructure where integration and continuous data acquisition and communication are required. Recently, the indirect approach to obtain BP values has been intensively investigated, where BP is mathematically derived through the “Time Delay” in propagation of pressure waves in the vascular system. This holds promise for the realization of cuffless and continuous BP monitoring systems, for both patients and healthy populations in both inpatient and outpatient settings. This review highlights recent efforts in developing these next-generation blood pressure monitoring devices and compares various mathematical models. The unmet challenges and further developments that are crucial to develop “Time Delay”-based BP devices are also discussed.},

The proposed framework estimates the blood pressure (BP) values obtained from signals generated from 14 volunteers subjected to a series of exercise routines. Herein, the physiological signals were first pre-processed, followed by the extraction of complexity features from both the PPG and ECG. Subsequently the complexity features were used in regression models (artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and LASSO) to predict the BP. The performance of the approach was evaluated by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE) and the standard deviation (STD) of the predicted results and compared with the recommendations made by the British Hypertension Society (BHS) and Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). Complexity features from the ECG and PPG were investigated independently, along with the combined dataset. It was observed that the complexity features obtained from the combination of ECG and PPG signals resulted to an improved estimation accuracy for the BP. The most accurate DBP result of 5.15 ± 6.46 mmHg was obtained from ANN model, and SVM generated the most accurate prediction for the SBP which was estimated as 7.33 ± 9.53 mmHg. Results for DBP fall within recommended performance of the BHS but SBP is outside the range. Although initial results are promising, further improvements are required before the potential of this approach is fully realised.},

Pulse transit time is the time taken for the arterial pulse Pressure wave to travel from the aortic valve to a peripheral site. It is usually measured from the R wave on the electrocardiogram to a photoplethysmography signal. PTT is inversely proportional to blood pressure.

However, it is difficult to accurately measure PAT from ECG and PPG signals because they have inconsistent shapes owing to patient-specific physical characteristics, pathological conditions, and movements. Accordingly, complex preprocessing is required to estimate blood pressure based on PAT. In this paper, as an alternative solution, we propose a noninvasive continuous algorithm using the difference between ECG and PPG as a new feature that can include PAT information. The proposed algorithm is a deep CNN–LSTM-based multitasking machine learning model that outputs simultaneous prediction results of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP). We used a total of 48 patients on the PhysioNet website by splitting them into 38 patients for training and 10 patients for testing. The prediction accuracies of SBP and DBP were 0.0 ± 1.6 mmHg and 0.2 ± 1.3 mmHg, respectively.

The pulse transit time (PTT) is related to arterial stiffness and can be used to estimate systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Considering the complex multivariate physiological processes in human body, depending on only PTT doesn't give acceptable accuracy. This study extends the pulse transit time (PTT) based cuff less BP measurement method to include the heart rate (HR) as an additional information. A new model based on linear regression is proposed that include the HR to measure the BP. PTT only BP and the proposed PTT and HR based BP measurement models are tested using MIMIC database.

Methods: In this work, we propose a waveform-based hierarchical Artificial Neural Network - Long Short Term Memory (ANN-LSTM) model for BP estimation. The model consists of two hierarchy levels, where the lower hierarchy level uses ANNs to extract necessary morphological features from ECG and PPG waveforms and the upper hierarchy level uses LSTM layers to account for the time domain variation of the features extracted by lower hierarchy level. Results: The proposed model is evaluated on 39 subjects using the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentations (AAMI) standard and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard. The method satisfies both the standards in the estimation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). For the proposed network, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) for SBP estimation are 1.10 and 1.56 mmHg, respectively, and for DBP estimation are 0.58 and 0.85 mmHg, respectively. Conclusion: The performance of the proposed hierarchical ANN-LSTM model is found to be better than the other feature engineering-based networks. It is shown that the proposed model is able to automatically extract the necessary features and their time domain variations to estimate BP reliably in a noninvasive continuous manner. Significance: The method is expected to greatly facilitate the presently available mobile health-care gadgets in continuous BP estimation.},

The importance of evaluating hypertension taking into account different blood pressure (BP) profiles and BP variability (BPV) is increasingly being recognized, and is particularly relevant in Asian populations given the specific features of hypertension in the region (including greater salt sensitivity and a high rate of nocturnal hypertension). Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) is the gold standard for diagnosing hypertension and assessing 24-hour BP and provides data on several important parameters that cannot be obtained using any other form of BP measurement. In addition, ABPM parameters provide better information on cardio- and cerebrovascular risk than office BP. ABPM should be used in all patients with elevated BP, particularly those with unstable office or home BP, or who are suspected to have white-coat or masked hypertension. ABPM is also an important part of hypertension diagnosis and monitoring in high-risk patients. ABPM needs to be performed using a validated device and good practice techniques, and has a role both in hypertension diagnosis and in monitoring the response to antihypertensive therapy to ensure strict BP control throughout the 24-hour period. Use of ABPM in clinical practice may be limited by cost and accessibility, and practical education of physicians and patients is essential. The ABPM evidence and practice points in this document are based on the Hypertension Cardiovascular Outcome Prevention and Evidence (HOPE) Asia Network expert panel consensus recommendations for ABPM in Asia.},

The development of new technologies which allow for remote BP monitoring without the use of a cuff may aid in more extensive adoption of BPT. This would enhance patient autonomy while providing physicians with a more complete picture of their patient's BP profile, potentially leading to improved BP control and better long-term clinical outcomes. This mini-review article aims to: (1) describe the fundamentals of current techniques in cuff-less BP measurement; (2) present examples of commercially available cuff-less technologies for BPT; (3) outline challenges with current methodologies; and (4) describe potential future directions in cuff-less BPT development.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop an intensive care unit research database applying automated techniques to aggregate high-resolution diagnostic and therapeutic data from a large, diverse population of adult intensive care unit patients. This freely available database is intended to support epidemiologic research in critical care medicine and serve as a resource to evaluate new clinical decision support and monitoring algorithms. DESIGN: Data collection and retrospective analysis. SETTING: All adult intensive care units (medical intensive care unit, surgical intensive care unit, cardiac care unit, cardiac surgery recovery unit) at a tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Adult patients admitted to intensive care units between 2001 and 2007. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II) database consists of 25,328 intensive care unit stays. The investigators collected detailed information about intensive care unit patient stays, including laboratory data, therapeutic intervention profiles such as vasoactive medication drip rates and ventilator settings, nursing progress notes, discharge summaries, radiology reports, provider order entry data, International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, and, for a subset of patients, high-resolution vital sign trends and waveforms. Data were automatically deidentified to comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards and integrated with relational database software to create electronic intensive care unit records for each patient stay. The data were made freely available in February 2010 through the Internet along with a detailed user's guide and an assortment of data processing tools. The overall hospital mortality rate was 11.7\%, which varied by critical care unit. The median intensive care unit length of stay was 2.2 days (interquartile range, 1.1-4.4 days). According to the primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, the following disease categories each comprised at least 5\% of the case records: diseases of the circulatory system (39.1\%); trauma (10.2\%); diseases of the digestive system (9.7\%); pulmonary diseases (9.0\%); infectious diseases (7.0\%); and neoplasms (6.8\%). CONCLUSIONS: MIMIC-II documents a diverse and very large population of intensive care unit patient stays and contains comprehensive and detailed clinical data, including physiological waveforms and minute-by-minute trends for a subset of records. It establishes a new public-access resource for critical care research, supporting a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule development, and electronic tool development.

   abstract = {This work proposes a method for reconstruction of mul-tivariate signals with missing parts of the data. The proposal consists in employing an artificial neural network (ANN), specifically recurrent multilayer perceptron (RMLP), to restore the missing intervals of the multivari-ate signals. In RMLP network, every neuron receives inputs from every other neuron in the network previous layer. In this approach, a RMLP was trained for each multi-variate signal in dataset. The network input patterns consist of a number of attributes which is the number of channels available, except for the channel with missing data. At each discrete time sample RMLP has input patterns and one desired output that is the channel with missing data. For that channel with missing data, the input pattern contribution is the previous output from RMLP. The time variable ranges from the beginning to just before the missing data. Each pattern is presented to ANN more than once, as an iteration process. After training, this ANN is used to predict the missing values, with time within the missing part of the signal. The training was done in several situations, varying the number of iterations for training and the learning rate. Looking at results obtained from testing dataset, in general , optimal results were observed for good quality signals. On the other hand, signals which most of the channels are low quality, with low SNR, it was observed that when missing data channel had a moderate quality, the reconstruction was still good. However, if missing data channel was noisy, the reconstruction, in general, was not good. This could be explained by the fact that ANN is strongly dependent on the desired output channel, getting to learn with certain efficiency even when some of the inputs are noisy.},

   abstract = {Real-time monitoring of vital physiological signals is of significant clinical relevance. Disruptions in the signals are frequently encountered and make it difficult for precise diagnosis. Thus, the ability to accurately predict/recover the lost signals could greatly impact medical research and application. In response to the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2010: Mind the Gap, we develop an algorithm based on artificial neural networks to predict the missing signals in one channel using the measurements in other channels. An artificial neural network model is created for each record, which consists of 6, 7, or 8 signals acquired from bedside ICU patient monitors. We first train the network using data from the beginning 9.5 minutes of the record. Then, we reconstruct the missing data in the subsequent 30 seconds for a specific channel. A few techniques are utilized to improve the performance of the model. Principal component analysis is used to reduce complexity and computational cost. Noisy signals are smoothed using a wavelet-based de-noising algorithm before training and testing. We explored three different neural networks: focused time-delayed neural network, distributed time-delayed neural network, and nonlinear autoregressive network with ex-ogenous inputs. The focused time-delayed neural network is more computationally efficient while the other two networks provide slightly more precise predictions. For highly correlated data sets, all three networks are able to produce accurate predictions; however, predictions of chaotic and highly noisy data sets are less satisfactory.},

Using the signals' history we identified the interconnections between the signals in the form of composite IIR transfer functions. Assuming that the connections do not vary in time, we managed to reconstruct the missing signals using the yet available parallel measured signals and the transfer functions. Since this assumption holds only for short timeperiod, we restricted the identification of the transfer function to segments prior the missing signal shorter than 30 seconds. Our results are promising on the challenge dataset. We concluded that this approach can be efficient in reconstructing and even detecting missing or corrupted car-diovascular signals or other type of datasets with several modalities and strong interconnections between them.},

   abstract = {The 2010 PhysioNet Challenge was to predict the last few seconds of a physiological waveform given its previous history and M-1 different concurrent physiological recordings. A robust approach was implemented by using a bank of adaptive filters to predict the desired channel. In all, M channels (the M-1 original signals, and 1 signal derived from the previous history of the target signal) were used to estimate the missing data. For each channel, a Gradient Adaptive Lattice Laguerre filter (GALL) was trained to estimate the desired channel. The GALL filter was chosen because of its fast convergence, stability, and ability to model a long response using relatively few parameters. The prediction of each of the channels (the output of each of the GALL filters) was then linearly combined using time-varying weights determined through a Kalman filter. This approach is extensible to recordings with any number of signals, other types of signals, and other problem domains. The code for the algorithm is freely available at PhysioNet under the GPL.},

This year, we present 4 new recommendations, as well as revisions to 2 previous recommendations. In the diagnosis and assessment of hypertension, automated office blood pressure, taken without patient-health provider interaction, is now recommended as the preferred method of measuring in-office blood pressure. Also, although a serum lipid panel remains part of the routine laboratory testing for patients with hypertension, fasting and nonfasting collections are now considered acceptable. For individuals with secondary hypertension arising from primary hyperaldosteronism, adrenal vein sampling is recommended for those who are candidates for potential adrenalectomy. With respect to the treatment of hypertension, a new recommendation that has been added is for increasing dietary potassium to reduce blood pressure in those who are not at high risk for hyperkalemia. Furthermore, in selected high-risk patients, intensive blood pressure reduction to a target systolic blood pressure ≤ 120 mm Hg should be considered to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events. Finally, in hypertensive individuals with uncomplicated, stable angina pectoris, either a β-blocker or calcium channel blocker may be considered for initial therapy. The specific evidence and rationale underlying each of these recommendations are discussed. Hypertension Canada's Canadian Hypertension Education Program Guidelines Task Force will continue to provide annual updates.},

   abstract = {This review portrays how ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was established and recommended as the method of choice for the assessment of BP and for the rational use of antihypertensive drugs. To establish much-needed diagnostic ambulatory BP thresholds, initial statistical approaches evolved into longitudinal studies of patients and populations, which demonstrated that cardiovascular complications are more closely associated with 24-hour and nighttime BP than with office BP. Studies cross-classifying individuals based on ambulatory and office BP thresholds identified white-coat hypertension, an elevated office BP in the presence of ambulatory normotension as a low-risk condition, whereas its counterpart, masked hypertension, carries a hazard almost as high as ambulatory combined with office hypertension. What clinically matters most is the level of the 24-hour and the nighttime BP, while other BP indexes derived from 24-hour ambulatory BP recordings, on top of the 24-hour and nighttime BP level, add little to risk stratification or hypertension management. Ambulatory BP monitoring is cost-effective. Ambulatory and home BP monitoring are complimentary approaches. Their interchangeability provides great versatility in the clinical implementation of out-of-office BP measurement. We are still waiting for evidence from randomized clinical trials to prove that out-of-office BP monitoring is superior to office BP in adjusting antihypertensive drug treatment and in the prevention of cardiovascular complications. A starting research line, the development of a standardized validation protocol for wearable BP monitoring devices, might facilitate the clinical applicability of ambulatory BP monitoring.},

We develop a method for estimating the systolic and diastolic blood pressure using a single-point optical recording of a photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal. The estimation is data-driven, we use automated machine learning algorithms instead of mathematical models. Combining supervised learning with a discrete wavelet transform, the method is insensitive to minor irregularities in the PPG waveform, hence both pulse oximeters and smartphone cameras can record the signal. We evaluate the accuracy of the estimation on 78 samples from 65 subjects (40 male, 25 female, age 29±7) with no history of cardiovascular disease. The estimate for systolic blood pressure has a mean error 4.9±4.9 mm Hg, and 4.3±3.7 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure when using the oximeter-obtained PPG. The same values are 5.1±4.3 mm Hg and 4.6±4.3 mm Hg when using the phone-obtained PPG, comparing with A&D UA-767PBT result as gold standard. The simplicity of the method encourages ambulatory measurement, and given the ease of sharing the measured data, we expect a shift to data-oriented approaches deriving insight from ubiquitous mobile devices that will yield more accurate machine learning models in monitoring blood pressure.},

FFT at 1Hz relates to 60 BPM and FFT at 0.25 Hz relates to 15 respiratory cycles per minute. For BP Measurement, the pulse height of PPG is proportional to the difference between the systolic and the diastolic pressure in the arteries. The standard blood pressure monitoring instrument is used to calculate correlation coefficient. The arterial blood pressure is calculated based on these coefficients. PPG signal is used to detect blood pressure pulsations in a finger and achieved an accuracy of (0.8 ± 7) mmHg and (0.9 ± 6) mmHg for systolic and diastolic pressure, respectively.

Although it is proven that PTT has a strong correlation with the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, this relation is highly dependent to each individuals physiological properties. Therefore, it requires per person calibration for accurate and reliable blood pressure estimation from PTT, which is a big drawback. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, a novel method is proposed for accurate and reliable estimation of blood pressure that is calibration-free. This goal is accomplished by extraction of several physiological parameters from Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal as well as utilizing signal processing and machine learning algorithms. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed method achieves grade B for the estimation of the diastolic blood pressure and grade C for the estimation of the mean arterial pressure under the standard British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol.},

   abstract = {Pulse transit time (PTT) has attracted much interest for cuffless blood pressure (BP) measurement. However, its limited accuracy is one of the main problems preventing its widespread acceptance. Arterial BP oscillates mainly at high frequency (HF) because of respiratory activity, and at low frequency (LF) because of vasomotor tone. Prior studies suggested that PTT can track BP variation in HF range, but was inadequate to follow the LF variation, which is probably the main reason for its unsatisfactory accuracy. This paper presents a new indicator, the photoplethysmogram intensity ratio (PIR), which can be affected by changes in the arterial diameter, and, thus, trace the LF variation of BP. Spectral analysis of BP, PTT, PIR, and respiratory signal confirmed that PTT was related to BP in HF at the respiratory frequency, while PIR was associated with BP in LF range. We, therefore, develop a novel BP estimation algorithm by using both PTT and PIR. The proposed algorithm was validated on 27 healthy subjects with continuous Finapres BP as reference. The results showed that the mean ± standard deviation (SD) for the estimated systolic, diastolic, and mean BP with the proposed method against reference were -0.37 ± 5.21, -0.08 ± 4.06, -0.18 ± 4.13 mmHg, and mean absolute difference (MAD) were 4.09, 3.18, 3.18 mmHg, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method outperformed the two most cited PTT algorithms for about 2 mmHg in SD and MAD. These results demonstrated that the proposed BP model using PIR and PTT can estimate continuous BP with improved accuracy.},

   abstract = {Accurate automatic noninvasive assessment of blood pressure (BP) presents a challenge due to conditions like arrhythmias, obesity, and postural changes that tend to obfuscate arterial amplitude pulsations sensed by the cuff. Researchers tried to overcome this challenge by analyzing oscillometric pulses with the aid of a higher fidelity signalthe electrocardiogram (ECG). Moreover, pulse transit time (PTT) was employed to provide an additional method for BP estimation. However, these methods were not fully developed, suitably integrated, or tested. To address these issues, we present a novel method whereby ECG-assisted oscillometric and PTT (measured between ECG R-peaks and maximum slope of arterial pulse peaks) analyses are seamlessly integrated into the oscillometric BP measurement paradigm. The method bolsters oscillometric analysis (amplitude modulation) with more reliable ECG R-peaks provides a complementary measure with PTT analysis (temporal modulation) and fuses this information for robust BP estimation. We have integrated this technology into a prototype that comprises a BP cuff with an embedded conductive fabric ECG electrode, associated hardware, and algorithms. A pilot study has been undertaken on ten healthy subjects (150 recordings) to validate the performance of our prototype against United States Food and Drug Administration approved Omron oscillometric monitor (HEM-790IT). Our prototype achieves mean absolute difference of less than 5 mmHg and grade A as per the British Hypertension Society protocol for estimating BP, with the reference Omron monitor. © 2011 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Background Modern clinical environments are laden with technology devices continuously gathering physiological data from patients. This is especially true in critical care environments, where life-saving decisions may have to be made on the basis of signals from monitoring devices. Hemodynamic monitoring is essential in dialysis, surgery, and in critically ill patients. For the most severe patients, blood pressure is normally assessed through a catheter, which is an invasive procedure that may result in adverse effects. Blood pressure can also be monitored noninvasively through different methods and these data can be used for the continuous assessment of pressure using machine learning methods. Previous studies have found pulse transit time to be related to blood pressure. In this short paper, we propose to study the feasibility of implementing a data-driven model based on restricted Boltzmann machine artificial neural networks, delivering a first proof of concept for the validity and viability of a method for blood pressure prediction based on these models. Summary and Key Messages For the most severe patients (e.g., dialysis, surgery, and the critically ill), blood pressure is normally assessed through invasive catheters. Alternatively, noninvasive methods have also been developed for its monitorization. Data obtained from noninvasive measurements can be used for the continuous assessment of pressure using machine learning methods. In this study, a restricted Boltzmann machine artificial neural network is used to present a first proof of concept for the validity and viability of a method for blood pressure prediction.},

   abstract = {Considering the existing issues of traditional blood pressure (BP) measurement methods and non-invasive continuous BP measurement techniques, this study aims to establish the systolic BP and diastolic BP estimation models based on machine learning using pulse transit time and characteristics of pulse waveform. In the process of model construction, the mean impact value method was introduced to investigate the impact of each feature on the models and the genetic algorithm was introduced to implement parameter optimization. The experimental results showed that the proposed models could effectively describe the nonlinear relationship between the features and BP and had higher accuracy than the traditional methods with the error of 3.27 ± 5.52 mmHg for systolic BP and 1.16 ± 1.97 mmHg for diastolic BP. Moreover, the estimation errors met the requirements of the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation and British Hypertension Society criteria. In conclusion, this study was helpful in promoting the practical application of methods for non-invasive continuous BP estimation models.},

@article{Fujita2019,
   abstract = {This paper proposes a cuFF-less systolic blood pressure (SBP) estimation method using partial least-squares (PLS) regression. Level-crossing features (LCFs) were used in this method, which were extracted from the contour lines arbitrarily drawn on the second-derivative photoplethysmography waveform. Unlike conventional height ratio features (HRFs), which are extracted on the basis of the peaks in the waveform, LCFs can be reliably extracted even if there are missing peaks in the waveform. However, the features extracted from adjacent contour lines show similar trends; thus, there is a strong correlation between the features, which leads to multicollinearity when conventional multiple regression analysis (MRA) is used. Hence, we developed a multivariate estimation method based on PLS regression to address this issue and estimate the SBP on the basis of the LCFs. Two-hundred-and-sixty-five subjects (95 males and 170 females [(Mean ± Standard Deviation) SBP: 133.1 ± 18.4 mmHg; age: 62.8 ± 16.8 years] participated in the experiments. Of the total number of subjects, 180 were considered as learning data, while 85 were considered as testing data. The values of the correlation coefficient between the measured and estimated values were found to be 0.78 for the proposed method (LCFs + PLS), 0.58 for comparison method 1 (HRFs + MRA), and 0.62 for comparison method 2 (HRFs + MRA). The proposed method was therefore found to demonstrate the highest accuracy among the three methods being compared.},

@article{Su2017,
   abstract = {Existing methods for arterial blood pressure (BP) estimation directly map the input physiological signals to output BP values without explicitly modeling the underlying temporal dependencies in BP dynamics. As a result, these models suffer from accuracy decay over a long time and thus require frequent calibration. In this work, we address this issue by formulating BP estimation as a sequence prediction problem in which both the input and target are temporal sequences. We propose a novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) consisting of multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are incorporated with (1) a bidirectional structure to access larger-scale context information of input sequence, and (2) residual connections to allow gradients in deep RNN to propagate more effectively. The proposed deep RNN model was tested on a static BP dataset, and it achieved root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.90 and 2.66 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) prediction respectively, surpassing the accuracy of traditional BP prediction models. On a multi-day BP dataset, the deep RNN achieved RMSE of 3.84, 5.25, 5.80 and 5.81 mmHg for the 1st day, 2nd day, 4th day and 6th month after the 1st day SBP prediction, and 1.80, 4.78, 5.0, 5.21 mmHg for corresponding DBP prediction, respectively, which outperforms all previous models with notable improvement. The experimental results suggest that modeling the temporal dependencies in BP dynamics significantly improves the long-term BP prediction accuracy.},
