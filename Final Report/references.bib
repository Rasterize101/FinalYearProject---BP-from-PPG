   abstract = {Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24 h, short-term (~5 min), and ultra-short-term (<5 min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from ~2 min to 24 h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.},

For years, the cuff-based sphygmomanometer and the arterial invasive line have been the gold standards for care professionals to assess BP. During the past few decades, the wide spread of the oscillometry-based BP arm or wrist cuffs have made home-based BP assessment more convenient and accessible. However, the discontinuous nature, the inability to interface with mobile applications, the relative inaccuracy with movement, and the need for calibration have rendered those BP oscillometry devices inadequate for next-generation healthcare infrastructure where integration and continuous data acquisition and communication are required. Recently, the indirect approach to obtain BP values has been intensively investigated, where BP is mathematically derived through the “Time Delay” in propagation of pressure waves in the vascular system. This holds promise for the realization of cuffless and continuous BP monitoring systems, for both patients and healthy populations in both inpatient and outpatient settings. This review highlights recent efforts in developing these next-generation blood pressure monitoring devices and compares various mathematical models. The unmet challenges and further developments that are crucial to develop “Time Delay”-based BP devices are also discussed.},

Recently, the use of ECG monitors has proliferated; however, they are not enabled with BP estimation. We have developed a method for BP estimation using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Methods: Raw ECG data are filtered and segmented, and, following this, a complexity analysis is performed for feature extraction. Then, a machine-learning method is applied, combining a stacking-based classification module and a regression module for building systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) predictive models. In addition, the method allows a probability distribution-based calibration to adapt the models to a particular user. Results: Using ECG recordings from 51 different subjects, 3129 30-s ECG segments are constructed, and seven features are extracted. Using a train-validation-test evaluation, the method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.64 mmHg for SBP, 18.20 mmHg for DBP, and 13.52 mmHg for the MAP prediction. When models are calibrated, the MAE decreases to 7.72 mmHg for SBP, 9.45 mmHg for DBP and 8.13 mmHg for MAP. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that, when a probability distribution-based calibration is used, the proposed method can achieve results close to those of a certified medical device for BP estimation.},

The importance of evaluating hypertension taking into account different blood pressure (BP) profiles and BP variability (BPV) is increasingly being recognized, and is particularly relevant in Asian populations given the specific features of hypertension in the region (including greater salt sensitivity and a high rate of nocturnal hypertension). Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) is the gold standard for diagnosing hypertension and assessing 24-hour BP and provides data on several important parameters that cannot be obtained using any other form of BP measurement. In addition, ABPM parameters provide better information on cardio- and cerebrovascular risk than office BP. ABPM should be used in all patients with elevated BP, particularly those with unstable office or home BP, or who are suspected to have white-coat or masked hypertension. ABPM is also an important part of hypertension diagnosis and monitoring in high-risk patients. ABPM needs to be performed using a validated device and good practice techniques, and has a role both in hypertension diagnosis and in monitoring the response to antihypertensive therapy to ensure strict BP control throughout the 24-hour period. Use of ABPM in clinical practice may be limited by cost and accessibility, and practical education of physicians and patients is essential. The ABPM evidence and practice points in this document are based on the Hypertension Cardiovascular Outcome Prevention and Evidence (HOPE) Asia Network expert panel consensus recommendations for ABPM in Asia.},

The CWR and PPG sensors are placed on the sternum and left earlobe respectively. This paper presents a signal processing method based on wavelet transform and adaptive filtering to remove noise from CWR signals. Experimental data are collected from 43 subjects in various static postures and 26 subjects doing 6 different exercise tasks. Two mathematical models are used to calculate SBPs from PTTs/PATs. For 38 subjects participating in posture tasks, the best cumulative error percentage (CEP) is 92.28\% and for 21 subjects participating in exercise tasks, the best CEP is 82.61\%. The results show the proposed method is promising in estimating SBP using PTT. Additionally, removing PEP from PAT leads to improving results by around 9\%. The CWR sensors present a low-power, continuous and potentially wearable system with minimal body contact to monitor aortic valve mechanical activities directly. Results of this study, of wearable radar sensors, demonstrate the potential superiority of CWR-based PEP extraction for various medical monitoring applications, including BP measurement.},

Traditionally, a cuff-based monitor with data communication capabilities has been used for BPT; however, cuff-based measurements are inconvenient and cause discomfort, which has prevented the widespread use of cuff-based monitors for BPT. The development of new technologies which allow for remote BP monitoring without the use of a cuff may aid in more extensive adoption of BPT. This would enhance patient autonomy while providing physicians with a more complete picture of their patient's BP profile, potentially leading to improved BP control and better long-term clinical outcomes. This mini-review article aims to: (1) describe the fundamentals of current techniques in cuff-less BP measurement; (2) present examples of commercially available cuff-less technologies for BPT; (3) outline challenges with current methodologies; and (4) describe potential future directions in cuff-less BPT development.},

Methods: In this work, we propose a waveform-based hierarchical Artificial Neural Network - Long Short Term Memory (ANN-LSTM) model for BP estimation. The model consists of two hierarchy levels, where the lower hierarchy level uses ANNs to extract necessary morphological features from ECG and PPG waveforms and the upper hierarchy level uses LSTM layers to account for the time domain variation of the features extracted by lower hierarchy level. Results: The proposed model is evaluated on 39 subjects using the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentations (AAMI) standard and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard. The method satisfies both the standards in the estimation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). For the proposed network, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) for SBP estimation are 1.10 and 1.56 mmHg, respectively, and for DBP estimation are 0.58 and 0.85 mmHg, respectively. Conclusion: The performance of the proposed hierarchical ANN-LSTM model is found to be better than the other feature engineering-based networks. It is shown that the proposed model is able to automatically extract the necessary features and their time domain variations to estimate BP reliably in a noninvasive continuous manner. Significance: The method is expected to greatly facilitate the presently available mobile health-care gadgets in continuous BP estimation.},

For individuals with secondary hypertension arising from primary hyperaldosteronism, adrenal vein sampling is recommended for those who are candidates for potential adrenalectomy. With respect to the treatment of hypertension, a new recommendation that has been added is for increasing dietary potassium to reduce blood pressure in those who are not at high risk for hyperkalemia. Furthermore, in selected high-risk patients, intensive blood pressure reduction to a target systolic blood pressure ≤ 120 mm Hg should be considered to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events. Finally, in hypertensive individuals with uncomplicated, stable angina pectoris, either a β-blocker or calcium channel blocker may be considered for initial therapy. The specific evidence and rationale underlying each of these recommendations are discussed.

	abstract     = {This review portrays how ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was established and recommended as the method of choice for the assessment of BP and for the rational use of antihypertensive drugs. To establish much-needed diagnostic ambulatory BP thresholds, initial statistical approaches evolved into longitudinal studies of patients and populations, which demonstrated that cardiovascular complications are more closely associated with 24-hour and nighttime BP than with office BP. Studies cross-classifying individuals based on ambulatory and office BP thresholds identified white-coat hypertension, an elevated office BP in the presence of ambulatory normotension as a low-risk condition, whereas its counterpart, masked hypertension, carries a hazard almost as high as ambulatory combined with office hypertension. What clinically matters most is the level of the 24-hour and the nighttime BP, while other BP indexes derived from 24-hour ambulatory BP recordings, on top of the 24-hour and nighttime BP level, add little to risk stratification or hypertension management. Ambulatory BP monitoring is cost-effective. Ambulatory and home BP monitoring are complimentary approaches. Their interchangeability provides great versatility in the clinical implementation of out-of-office BP measurement. We are still waiting for evidence from randomized clinical trials to prove that out-of-office BP monitoring is superior to office BP in adjusting antihypertensive drug treatment and in the prevention of cardiovascular complications. A starting research line, the development of a standardized validation protocol for wearable BP monitoring devices, might facilitate the clinical applicability of ambulatory BP monitoring.},

The proposed framework estimates the blood pressure (BP) values obtained from signals generated from 14 volunteers subjected to a series of exercise routines. Herein, the physiological signals were first pre-processed, followed by the extraction of complexity features from both the PPG and ECG. Subsequently the complexity features were used in regression models (artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and LASSO) to predict the BP. The performance of the approach was evaluated by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE) and the standard deviation (STD) of the predicted results and compared with the recommendations made by the British Hypertension Society (BHS) and Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). Complexity features from the ECG and PPG were investigated independently, along with the combined dataset. It was observed that the complexity features obtained from the combination of ECG and PPG signals resulted to an improved estimation accuracy for the BP. The most accurate DBP result of 5.15 ± 6.46 mmHg was obtained from ANN model, and SVM generated the most accurate prediction for the SBP which was estimated as 7.33 ± 9.53 mmHg. Results for DBP fall within recommended performance of the BHS but SBP is outside the range. Although initial results are promising, further improvements are required before the potential of this approach is fully realised.},

Moreover, pulse transit time (PTT) was employed to provide an additional method for BP estimation. However, these methods were not fully developed, suitably integrated, or tested. To address these issues, we present a novel method whereby ECG-assisted oscillometric and PTT (measured between ECG R-peaks and maximum slope of arterial pulse peaks) analyses are seamlessly integrated into the oscillometric BP measurement paradigm. The method bolsters oscillometric analysis (amplitude modulation) with more reliable ECG R-peaks provides a complementary measure with PTT analysis (temporal modulation) and fuses this information for robust BP estimation. We have integrated this technology into a prototype that comprises a BP cuff with an embedded conductive fabric ECG electrode, associated hardware, and algorithms. A pilot study has been undertaken on ten healthy subjects (150 recordings) to validate the performance of our prototype against United States Food and Drug Administration approved Omron oscillometric monitor (HEM-790IT).

	abstract     = {Pulse transit time (PTT) has attracted much interest for cuffless blood pressure (BP) measurement. However, its limited accuracy is one of the main problems preventing its widespread acceptance. Arterial BP oscillates mainly at high frequency (HF) because of respiratory activity, and at low frequency (LF) because of vasomotor tone. Prior studies suggested that PTT can track BP variation in HF range, but was inadequate to follow the LF variation, which is probably the main reason for its unsatisfactory accuracy. This paper presents a new indicator, the photoplethysmogram intensity ratio (PIR), which can be affected by changes in the arterial diameter, and, thus, trace the LF variation of BP. Spectral analysis of BP, PTT, PIR, and respiratory signal confirmed that PTT was related to BP in HF at the respiratory frequency, while PIR was associated with BP in LF range. We, therefore, develop a novel BP estimation algorithm by using both PTT and PIR. The proposed algorithm was validated on 27 healthy subjects with continuous Finapres BP as reference. The results showed that the mean ± standard deviation (SD) for the estimated systolic, diastolic, and mean BP with the proposed method against reference were -0.37 ± 5.21, -0.08 ± 4.06, -0.18 ± 4.13 mmHg, and mean absolute difference (MAD) were 4.09, 3.18, 3.18 mmHg, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method outperformed the two most cited PTT algorithms for about 2 mmHg in SD and MAD. These results demonstrated that the proposed BP model using PIR and PTT can estimate continuous BP with improved accuracy.},

The estimation is data-driven, we use automated machine learning algorithms instead of mathematical models. Combining supervised learning with a discrete wavelet transform, the method is insensitive to minor irregularities in the PPG waveform, hence both pulse oximeters and smartphone cameras can record the signal. We evaluate the accuracy of the estimation on 78 samples from 65 subjects (40 male, 25 female, age 29±7) with no history of cardiovascular disease. The estimate for systolic blood pressure has a mean error 4.9±4.9 mm Hg, and 4.3±3.7 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure when using the oximeter-obtained PPG. The same values are 5.1±4.3 mm Hg and 4.6±4.3 mm Hg when using the phone-obtained PPG, comparing with A&D UA-767PBT result as gold standard. The simplicity of the method encourages ambulatory measurement, and given the ease of sharing the measured data, we expect a shift to data-oriented approaches deriving insight from ubiquitous mobile devices that will yield more accurate machine learning models in monitoring blood pressure.},

Therefore, it requires per person calibration for accurate and reliable blood pressure estimation from PTT, which is a big drawback. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, a novel method is proposed for accurate and reliable estimation of blood pressure that is calibration-free. This goal is accomplished by extraction of several physiological parameters from Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal as well as utilizing signal processing and machine learning algorithms.

This is especially true in critical care environments, where life-saving decisions may have to be made on the basis of signals from monitoring devices.

For the most severe patients, blood pressure is normally assessed through a catheter, which is an invasive procedure that may result in adverse effects. Blood pressure can also be monitored noninvasively through different methods and these data can be used for the continuous assessment of pressure using machine learning methods. Previous studies have found pulse transit time to be related to blood pressure. In this short paper, we propose to study the feasibility of implementing a data-driven model based on restricted Boltzmann machine artificial neural networks, delivering a first proof of concept for the validity and viability of a method for blood pressure prediction based on these models.

As photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals can be recorded non-invasively, research has been highly conducted to measure BP using PPG recently. In this paper, we propose a U-net deep learning architecture that uses fingertip PPG signal as input to estimate arterial BP (ABP) waveform non-invasively. From this waveform, we have also measured systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 100 subjects from two publicly available databases: MIMIC and MIMIC-III. The predicted ABP waveforms correlated highly with the reference waveforms and we have obtained an average Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.993. The mean absolute error is 3.68 ± 4.42 mmHg for SBP, 1.97 ± 2.92 mmHg for DBP, and 2.17 ± 3.06 mmHg for MAP which satisfy the requirements of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard and obtain grade A according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard. The results show that the proposed method is an efficient process to estimate ABP waveform directly using fingertip PPG.},

	abstract     = {Objective: Continuous blood pressure (BP) provides valuable information for the disease management of patients with arrhythmias. The traditional intra-arterial method is too invasive for routine healthcare settings, whereas cuff-based devices are inferior in reliability and comfortable for long-term BP monitoring during arrhythmias. The study aimed to investigate an indirect method for continuous and cuff-less BP estimation based on electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals during arrhythmias and to test its reliability for the determination of BP using invasive BP (IBP) as reference. Methods: Thirty-five clinically stable patients (15 with ventricular arrhythmias and 20 with supraventricular arrhythmias) who had undergone radiofrequency ablation were enrolled in this study. Their ECG, PPG, and femoral arterial IBP signals were simultaneously recorded with a multi-parameter monitoring system. Fifteen features that have the potential ability in indicating beat-to-beat BP changes during arrhythmias were extracted from the ECG and PPG signals. Four machine learning algorithms, decision tree regression (DTR), support vector machine regression (SVR), adaptive boosting regression (AdaboostR), and random forest regression (RFR), were then implemented to develop the BP models. Results: The results showed that the mean value ± standard deviation of root mean square error for the estimated systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) with the RFR model against the reference in all patients were 5.87 ± 3.13 and 3.52 ± 1.38 mmHg, respectively, which achieved the best performance among all the models. Furthermore, the mean error ± standard deviation of error between the estimated SBP and DBP with the RFR model against the reference in all patients were −0.04 ± 6.11 and 0.11 ± 3.62 mmHg, respectively, which complied with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation and the British Hypertension Society (Grade A) standards. Conclusion: The results indicated that the utilization of ECG and PPG signals has the potential to enable cuff-less and continuous BP estimation in an indirect way for patients with arrhythmias.},

	abstract     = {The pulse arrival time (PAT), the difference between the R-peak time of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and the systolic peak of photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, is an indicator that enables noninvasive and continuous blood pressure estimation. However, it is difficult to accurately measure PAT from ECG and PPG signals because they have inconsistent shapes owing to patient-specific physical characteristics, pathological conditions, and movements. Accordingly, complex preprocessing is required to estimate blood pressure based on PAT. In this paper, as an alternative solution, we propose a noninvasive continuous algorithm using the difference between ECG and PPG as a new feature that can include PAT information. The proposed algorithm is a deep CNN–LSTM-based multitasking machine learning model that outputs simultaneous prediction results of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP). We used a total of 48 patients on the PhysioNet website by splitting them into 38 patients for training and 10 patients for testing. The prediction accuracies of SBP and DBP were 0.0 ± 1.6 mmHg and 0.2 ± 1.3 mmHg, respectively. Even though the proposed model was assessed with only 10 patients, this result was satisfied with three guidelines, which are the BHS, AAMI, and IEEE standards for blood pressure measurement devices.},

Beside the inconvenience of cuff based blood pressure (BP) measurement devices, the lack of widely accepted accurate measurements and calibration, the BP portable devices are even less attractive. The pulse transit time (PTT) is related to arterial stiffness and can be used to estimate systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Considering the complex multivariate physiological processes in human body, depending on only PTT doesn't give acceptable accuracy. This study extends the pulse transit time (PTT) based cuff less BP measurement method to include the heart rate (HR) as an additional information. A new model based on linear regression is proposed that include the HR to measure the BP. PTT only BP and the proposed PTT and HR based BP measurement models are tested using MIMIC database. Using model including linear regression and curve fitting, it was shown that the proposed model reduced the BP root mean square error (RMSE) for SBP from 9.6 to 7.1 and for DBP from 4.2 to 3.1 compared to conventional PTT only based methods.},

Level-crossing features (LCFs) were used in this method, which were extracted from the contour lines arbitrarily drawn on the second-derivative photoplethysmography waveform. Unlike conventional height ratio features (HRFs), which are extracted on the basis of the peaks in the waveform, LCFs can be reliably extracted even if there are missing peaks in the waveform. However, the features extracted from adjacent contour lines show similar trends; thus, there is a strong correlation between the features, which leads to multicollinearity when conventional multiple regression analysis (MRA) is used. Hence, we developed a multivariate estimation method based on PLS regression to address this issue and estimate the SBP on the basis of the LCFs. Two-hundred-and-sixty-five subjects (95 males and 170 females [(Mean ± Standard Deviation) SBP: 133.1 ± 18.4 mmHg; age: 62.8 ± 16.8 years] participated in the experiments. Of the total number of subjects, 180 were considered as learning data, while 85 were considered as testing data. The values of the correlation coefficient between the measured and estimated values were found to be 0.78 for the proposed method (LCFs + PLS), 0.58 for comparison method 1 (HRFs + MRA), and 0.62 for comparison method 2 (HRFs + MRA). The proposed method was therefore found to demonstrate the highest accuracy among the three methods being compared.},

As a result, these models suffer from accuracy decay over a long time and thus require frequent calibration. In this work, we address this issue by formulating BP estimation as a sequence prediction problem in which both the input and target are temporal sequences. We propose a novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) consisting of multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are incorporated with (1) a bidirectional structure to access larger-scale context information of input sequence, and (2) residual connections to allow gradients in deep RNN to propagate more effectively. The proposed deep RNN model was tested on a static BP dataset, and it achieved root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.90 and 2.66 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) prediction respectively, surpassing the accuracy of traditional BP prediction models. On a multi-day BP dataset, the deep RNN achieved RMSE of 3.84, 5.25, 5.80 and 5.81 mmHg for the 1st day, 2nd day, 4th day and 6th month after the 1st day SBP prediction, and 1.80, 4.78, 5.0, 5.21 mmHg for corresponding DBP prediction, respectively, which outperforms all previous models with notable improvement. The experimental results suggest that modeling the temporal dependencies in BP dynamics significantly improves the long-term BP prediction accuracy.},

We propose a system in which photoplethysmogram (PPG) is used to continuously estimate BP. A PPG sensor can be easily embedded in a modern wearable device, which can be used in such an approach. The PPG signal is first preprocessed in order to remove major noise and movement artefacts present in the signal. A set of features describing the PPG signal on a per-cycle basis is then computed to be used in regression models. The predictive performance of the models is improved by first using the RReliefF algorithm to select a subset of relevant features. Afterwards, personalization of the models is considered to further improve the performance. The approach is validated using two distinct datasets, one from a hospital environment and the other collected during every-day activities. Using the MIMIC hospital dataset, the best achieved mean absolute errors (MAE) in a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) experiment were 4.47 mmHg for systolic and 2.02 mmHg for diastolic BP, at maximum personalization. For everyday-life dataset, the lowest errors in the same LOSO experiment were 8.57 mmHg for systolic and 4.42 mmHg for diastolic BP, again using maximum personalization. The best performing algorithm was an ensemble of regression trees.},

	abstract     = {Preventive healthcare requires continuous monitoring of the blood pressure (BP) of patients, which is not feasible using conventional methods. Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals can be effectively used for this purpose as there is a physiological relation between the pulse width and BP and can be easily acquired using a wearable PPG sensor. However, developing real-time algorithms for wearable technology is a significant challenge due to various conflicting requirements such as high accuracy, computationally constrained devices, and limited power supply. In this paper, we propose a novel feature set for continuous, real-time identification of abnormal BP. This feature set is obtained by identifying the peaks and valleys in a PPG signal (using a peak detection algorithm), followed by the calculation of rising time, falling time and peak-to-peak distance. The histograms of these times are calculated to form a feature set that can be used for classification of PPG signals into one of the two classes: normal or abnormal BP. No public dataset is available for such study and therefore a prototype is developed to collect PPG signals alongside BP measurements. The proposed feature set shows very good performance with an overall accuracy of approximately 95%. Although the proposed feature set is effective, the significance of individual features varies greatly (validated using significance testing) which led us to perform weighted voting of features for classification by performing autoregressive modeling. Our experiments show that the simplest linear classifiers produce very good results indicating the strength of the proposed feature set. The weighted voting improves the results significantly, producing an overall accuracy of about 98%. Conclusively, the PPG signals can be effectively used to identify BP, and the proposed feature set is efficient and computationally feasible for implementation on standalone devices.},

	abstract     = {Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. It is vital to prevent it by rapid diagnosis and appropriate management through periodic blood pressure (BP) measurement. Recently, many studies have been conducted on methods to measure BP without a cuff. One of the most common methods of predicting BP without a cuff is to use the correlation between pulse wave velocity (PWV) and BP. Studies that predict BP through PWV have two problems to overcome: 1) Additional efforts are required to extract PWV features manually from various biomedical signals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG); and 2) in predicting BP using biomedical signals from other people, individual periodic calibration is required because the correlation between PWV and BP differs from person to person. In this study, we proposed a cuffless BP prediction method based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that can overcome the problems mentioned above. The proposed CNN method 1) can use raw signals for training without PWV feature extraction; and 2) automatically learns the characteristics of biomedical signals from other people to predict BP accurately without calibration. We propose two schemes: extraction through multiple dilated convolution, and concentration through strided convolution with a large kernel, to process sequential ECG and PPG signals through CNN. BP prediction performance was the best when both ECG and PPG signals were used together. To this end, we conducted extensive experiments on the different settings of the proposed method and constructed an effective learning model. The proposed method achieved excellent performance in predicting both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure over other known approaches. We also verified that the performance of our method fulfills international standard protocols, AAMI, and BHS.},

In the young population (<50 years old) with low, medium and high systolic blood pressures (SBP, <120 mmHg; 120–139 mmHg; ≥140 mmHg), the fitting errors are 6.3 ± 7.2, −3.9 ± 7.2 and −20.2 ± 14.2 mmHg for SBP respectively; In the older population (>50 years old) with the same categories, the fitting errors are 12.8 ± 9.0, 0.5 ± 8.2 and −14.6 ± 11.5 mmHg for SBP respectively. A simple personalized calibration reduces fitting errors significantly (n = 147), and good peripheral perfusion helps to improve the fitting accuracy. In conclusion, PPG may be used to calculate BP without calibration in certain populations. When calibrated, it shows great potential to serially monitor BP fluctuation, which can bring tremendous economic and health benefits.},

	abstract     = {Introduction. Blood pressure (BP) has been a potential risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. BP measurement is one of the most useful parameters for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. At present, BP measurement mainly relies on cuff-based techniques that cause inconvenience and discomfort to users. Although some of the present prototype cuffless BP measurement techniques are able to reach overall acceptable accuracies, they require an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a photoplethysmograph (PPG) that make them unsuitable for true wearable applications. Therefore, developing a single PPG-based cuffless BP estimation algorithm with enough accuracy would be clinically and practically useful. Methods. The University of Queensland vital sign dataset (online database) was accessed to extract raw PPG signals and its corresponding reference BPs (systolic BP and diastolic BP). The online database consisted of PPG waveforms of 32 cases from whom 8133 (good quality) signal segments (5 s for each) were extracted, preprocessed, and normalised in both width and amplitude. Three most significant pulse features (pulse area, pulse rising time, and width 25%) with their corresponding reference BPs were used to train and test three machine learning algorithms (regression tree, multiple linear regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM)). A 10-fold cross-validation was applied to obtain overall BP estimation accuracy, separately for the three machine learning algorithms. Their estimation accuracies were further analysed separately for three clinical BP categories (normotensive, hypertensive, and hypotensive). Finally, they were compared with the ISO standard for noninvasive BP device validation (average difference no greater than 5 mmHg and SD no greater than 8 mmHg). Results. In terms of overall estimation accuracy, the regression tree achieved the best overall accuracy for SBP (mean and SD of difference:-0.1 ± 6.5 mmHg) and DBP (mean and SD of difference:-0.6 ± 5.2 mmHg). MLR and SVM achieved the overall mean difference less than 5 mmHg for both SBP and DBP, but their SD of difference was >8 mmHg. Regarding the estimation accuracy in each BP categories, only the regression tree achieved acceptable ISO standard for SBP (-1.1 ± 5.7 mmHg) and DBP (-0.03 ± 5.6 mmHg) in the normotensive category. MLR and SVM did not achieve acceptable accuracies in any BP categories. Conclusion. This study developed and compared three machine learning algorithms to estimate BPs using PPG only and revealed that the regression tree algorithm was the best approach with overall acceptable accuracy to ISO standard for BP device validation. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the regression tree algorithm achieved acceptable measurement accuracy only in the normotensive category, suggesting that future algorithm development for BP estimation should be more specific for different BP categories.},

There is significant interest in the development of non-invasive, cuff-less and continual BP measurement based on physiological measurement. However, in these methods, extracting features from signals is challenging in the presence of noise or signal distortion. When using machine learning, errors in feature extraction result in errors in BP estimation, therefore, this study explores the use of raw signals as a direct input to a deep learning model. To enable comparison with the traditional machine learning models which use features from the photoplethysmogram and electrocardiogram, a hybrid deep learning model that utilises both raw signals and physical characteristics (age, height, weight and gender) is developed. This hybrid model performs best in terms of both diastolic BP (DBP) and systolic BP (SBP) with the mean absolute error being 3.23 ± 4.75 mmHg and 4.43 ± 6.09 mmHg respectively. DBP and SBP meet the Grade A and Grade B performance requirements of the British Hypertension Society respectively.},

In recent years, extensive studies have been conducted on non-invasive and cuff-less BP estimation using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. PPG is a non-invasive optical method for measuring blood volume changes per pulse. In other words, the PPG waveform represents the mechanical activity of the heart. Methods: In this paper, a new method for estimating the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) is proposed using only the PPG signal regardless of its shape (appropriate or inappropriate). Our proposed algorithm called whole-based, uses raw values of the PPG signal at a given time interval for estimating the BP. In other algorithms called parameter-based, use features which are extracted from PPG signals in time or frequency domain. These features related to precise spotting in the form of the PPG signal. In fact, compared to parameter-based methods, our algorithm is independent of the form of the PPG signal. Results: Using the proposed algorithm, our results are completely met by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard for both MAP and DBP estimations. The results are also very close to the standard boundary with an average error close to zero for SBP estimation. Also, according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard, the proposed algorithm for DBP estimation got grade A, whereas it got grade B for estimation of MAP and got approximately grade C for SBP estimation. Conclusion: The results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm in estimating BP noninvasively, cuff-less, calibration-free, and only by using the appropriate or inappropriate PPG signal.},

Methods: The proposed model consists of two key ingredients, using two successive stages. The first stage includes two convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract morphological features from each PPG segment and then to estimate systolic and diastolic BPs separately. The second stage relies on long short-term memory (LSTM) to capture temporal dependencies. Further, the method incorporates the dynamic relationship between systolic and diastolic BPs to improve accuracy. Results: The proposed multistage model was evaluated on 200 subjects using the standards of the British Hypertension Society (BHS) and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). The results revealed that our model performance met the requirements of the AAMI standard. Also, according to the BHS standard, it achieved grade A in estimating both systolic and diastolic BPs.

Experimental results indicate that the accuracy of the average regression model has error standard deviations of 10.6 ± 3.3 mmHg (PAT), 8.7 ± 3.2 mmHg (PWA) for SBP and 6.0 ± 2.3 mmHg (PAT), 4.4 ± 1.6 mmHg (PWA) for DBP on 23 subjects over a 1 day period. We defined a local-model which is extracted regression model from sparsely selected small dataset, contrast to full dataset for 24h (average-model). The limit of BP estimation accuracy from the local-model of PWA is lower than that of PAT-BP average-model. Whereas the error of the BP estimation local-model was reduced using more data for scaling, it required more than four times the 1 min data extracted over the 12 h calibration period to predict BP for 1 day. This study shows that PWA has possibility to estimate BP value and PAT-driven BP information could be used to determine the individual scale factors of the PWA-BP estimation model for home users.},

Several approaches that involve photoplethysmography (PPG) and Pulse Transit Time (PTT) have been explored with promising results; however the requirement of two sensors makes them obtrusive for continuous use. Single PPG sensor approaches using machine learning have also been attempted, but there are certain deficiencies in these methods as they go for a one-size-fits-all approach. In this work, we develop an ensemble of BP prediction models based on demographic and physiological partitioning. Also, we incorporate a set of unique PPG features into our models, which results in test accuracies of 5 mmHg Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for Diastolic BP, and 6.9 mmHg MAE for Systolic BP. Given our marked improvement over ubiquitous models (18% for Diastolic BP and 11.5% for Systolic BP), this approach opens up avenues where single PPG sensor based methods can predict BP with a high degree of accuracy. This is a big step towards developing continuous BP monitoring systems, and can help in better management of cardiac health.},

The Heart Rate (HR) (estimated from the finger PPG) and the PTT are then input in a linear model to give an estimation of the Systolic and Diastolic BP. The performance of the smartwatch in measuring BP have been validated in the Institut Coeur Paris Centre Turin (ICPC), using a sphygmomanometer, on 44 subjects. During the validation, the measures of the CareUp ® were compared to those of two oscillometry-based devices already available on the market: Thuasne ® and Magnien ®. The results showed an accuracy comparable to the oscillometry-based devices and they almost agreed with the American Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation standard for non-automated sphygmomanometers. The integration of the BP estimation algorithm in the smartwatch makes the CareUp ® an easy-to-use, wearable device for monitoring the BP in real time.},

	abstract     = {Continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement is crucial for reliable and timely hypertension detection. State-of-the-art continuous BP measurement methods based on pulse transit time or multiple parameters require simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Compared with PPG signals, ECG signals are easy to collect using wearable devices. This study examined a novel continuous BP estimation approach using one-channel ECG signals for unobtrusive BP monitoring. A BP model is developed based on the fusion of a residual network and long short-term memory to obtain the spatial-temporal information of ECG signals. The public multiparameter intelligent monitoring waveform database, which contains ECG, PPG, and invasive BP data of patients in intensive care units, is used to develop and verify the model. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach exhibited an estimation error of 0.07 ± 7.77 mmHg for mean arterial pressure (MAP) and 0.01 ± 6.29 for diastolic BP (DBP), which comply with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation standard. According to the British Hypertension Society standards, the results achieved grade A for MAP and DBP estimation and grade B for systolic BP (SBP) estimation. Furthermore, we verified the model with an independent dataset for arrhythmia patients. The experimental results exhibited an estimation error of −0.22 ± 5.82 mmHg, −0.57 ± 4.39 mmHg, and −0.75 ± 5.62 mmHg for SBP, MAP, and DBP measurements, respectively. These results indicate the feasibility of estimating BP by using a one-channel ECG signal, thus enabling continuous BP measurement for ubiquitous health care applications.},

A generalized model should be considered to decrease the training time, and the model reproducibility should be taken into account in multi-day scenarios. In this study, a BP estimation model with a bidirectional long short-term memory network is proposed. The features are extracted from the electrocardiogram, photoplethysmogram, and ballistocardiogram. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) method is incorporated to generalize the model and fine-tuning is applied. The model was evaluated using one-day and multi-day tests. The proposed model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.56 and 2.05 mmHg for the systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), respectively, in the one-day test. Moreover, the results demonstrated that the LOSO method with fine-tuning was more compatible in the multi-day test.

Methods: We first established the relationship between BP, PTT, and arterial impedance (i.e., the IPG observations). The IPG sensor was placed on the wrist while the photoplethysmography sensor was attached to the index finger to measure the PTT. With a cuff-based BP monitoring system placed on the upper arm as a reference, our proposed methodology was evaluated on 15 young, healthy human subjects leveraging handgrip exercises to manipulate BP/PTT and compared to several conventional PTT models to assess the efficacy of PTT/BP detections. Results: The proposed model correlated with BP fairly well with group average correlation coefficients of 0.88 ± 0.07 for systolic BP (SBP) and 0.88 ± 0.06 for diastolic BP (DBP). In comparison with the other PTT methods, PTT-IPG-based BP estimation provided a lower root-mean-squared-error of 8.47 ± 0.91, mmHg and 5.02 ± 0.73, mmHg for SBP and DBP, respectively. Conclusion: We conclude that the measurement of arterial impedance via IPG methods is an adequate indicator to estimate BP. The proposed method appears to offer superiority compared to the conventional PTT estimation approaches. Significance: Using impedance magnitude to estimate PTT offers promise to realize wearable and cuffless BP devices.},

Blood pressure is one of the four vital signs that provides important information regarding patients’ cardiovascular system conditions. Continuous and regular blood pressure monitoring is essential for early diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular disease. Considering the existing invasive or cuff-based blood pressuring monitoring techniques in clinical practice, several studies have identified motivation and advantages of a new non-invasive and cuffless blood pressuring measurement technique using Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. In this study, we propose several systolic and diastolic blood pressure estimation models using recurrent neural networks with bidirectional connections and attention mechanism utilising only PPG signals. The models were evaluated on PPG and blood pressure signals derived from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II database. In the process, 22 characteristic features were extracted from the PPG waveform followed by various dimensionality reduction techniques to eliminate redundancies and reduce computational complexity. The proposed models were evaluated on both the 22-feature set and the reduced input feature vector, respectively. The models were compared with four machine learning techniques commonly used in the literature. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed models could capture the non-linear relationship between the PPG features and blood pressure with high accuracy and outperformed the conventional machine learning methods on both datasets. The results for all the proposed models were acceptable by the global standards set by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation for cuffless blood pressure estimation.},

Continuous monitoring of BP is very important; however, cuff-based BP measurements are discrete and uncomfortable to the user. To address this need, a cuff-less, continuous, and noninvasive BP measurement system is proposed using the photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal and demographic features using machine learning (ML) algorithms. PPG signals were acquired from 219 subjects, which undergo preprocessing and feature extraction steps. Time, frequency, and time-frequency domain features were extracted from the PPG and their derivative signals. Feature selection techniques were used to reduce the computational complexity and to decrease the chance of over-fitting the ML algorithms. The features were then used to train and evaluate ML algorithms. The best regression models were selected for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimation individually. Gaussian process regression (GPR) along with the ReliefF feature selection algorithm outperforms other algorithms in estimating SBP and DBP with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.74 and 3.59, respectively. This ML model can be implemented in hardware systems to continuously monitor BP and avoid any critical health conditions due to sudden changes.},

The proposed model consisted of a convolutional neural network, a bidirectional gated recurrent unit, and an attention mechanism. The model was trained by a calibration-based method, using the data of each subject. The performance of the model was compared to the model that used each combination of the three signals, and the model with the attention mechanism showed better performance than other state-of-the-art methods, including conventional linear regression method using pulse transit time (PTT). A total of 15 subjects were recruited, and electrocardiogram, ballistocardiogram, and photoplethysmogram levels were measured. The 95% confidence interval of the reference BP was [86.34, 143.74] and [51.28, 88.74] for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively.

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},
