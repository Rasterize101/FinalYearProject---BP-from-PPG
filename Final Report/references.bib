   abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) is one of the most important monitoring parameters in clinical medicine. For years, the cuff-based sphygmomanometer and the arterial invasive line have been the gold standards for care professionals to assess BP. During the past few decades, the wide spread of the oscillometry-based BP arm or wrist cuffs have made home-based BP assessment more convenient and accessible. However, the discontinuous nature, the inability to interface with mobile applications, the relative inaccuracy with movement, and the need for calibration have rendered those BP oscillometry devices inadequate for next-generation healthcare infrastructure where integration and continuous data acquisition and communication are required. Recently, the indirect approach to obtain BP values has been intensively investigated, where BP is mathematically derived through the “Time Delay” in propagation of pressure waves in the vascular system. This holds promise for the realization of cuffless and continuous BP monitoring systems, for both patients and healthy populations in both inpatient and outpatient settings. This review highlights recent efforts in developing these next-generation blood pressure monitoring devices and compares various mathematical models. The unmet challenges and further developments that are crucial to develop “Time Delay”-based BP devices are also discussed.},

   abstract = {Background: Blood pressure (BP) measurements have been used widely in clinical and private environments. Recently, the use of ECG monitors has proliferated; however, they are not enabled with BP estimation. We have developed a method for BP estimation using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Methods: Raw ECG data are filtered and segmented, and, following this, a complexity analysis is performed for feature extraction. Then, a machine-learning method is applied, combining a stacking-based classification module and a regression module for building systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) predictive models. In addition, the method allows a probability distribution-based calibration to adapt the models to a particular user. Results: Using ECG recordings from 51 different subjects, 3129 30-s ECG segments are constructed, and seven features are extracted. Using a train-validation-test evaluation, the method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.64 mmHg for SBP, 18.20 mmHg for DBP, and 13.52 mmHg for the MAP prediction. When models are calibrated, the MAE decreases to 7.72 mmHg for SBP, 9.45 mmHg for DBP and 8.13 mmHg for MAP. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that, when a probability distribution-based calibration is used, the proposed method can achieve results close to those of a certified medical device for BP estimation.},

   abstract = {Hypertension is an important public health issue due to its association with a number of serious diseases, including cardiovascular disease and stroke. The importance of evaluating hypertension taking into account different blood pressure (BP) profiles and BP variability (BPV) is increasingly being recognized, and is particularly relevant in Asian populations given the specific features of hypertension in the region (including greater salt sensitivity and a high rate of nocturnal hypertension). Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) is the gold standard for diagnosing hypertension and assessing 24-hour BP and provides data on several important parameters that cannot be obtained using any other form of BP measurement. In addition, ABPM parameters provide better information on cardio- and cerebrovascular risk than office BP. ABPM should be used in all patients with elevated BP, particularly those with unstable office or home BP, or who are suspected to have white-coat or masked hypertension. ABPM is also an important part of hypertension diagnosis and monitoring in high-risk patients. ABPM needs to be performed using a validated device and good practice techniques, and has a role both in hypertension diagnosis and in monitoring the response to antihypertensive therapy to ensure strict BP control throughout the 24-hour period. Use of ABPM in clinical practice may be limited by cost and accessibility, and practical education of physicians and patients is essential. The ABPM evidence and practice points in this document are based on the Hypertension Cardiovascular Outcome Prevention and Evidence (HOPE) Asia Network expert panel consensus recommendations for ABPM in Asia.},

The CWR and PPG sensors are placed on the sternum and left earlobe respectively. This paper presents a signal processing method based on wavelet transform and adaptive filtering to remove noise from CWR signals. Experimental data are collected from 43 subjects in various static postures and 26 subjects doing 6 different exercise tasks. Two mathematical models are used to calculate SBPs from PTTs/PATs. For 38 subjects participating in posture tasks, the best cumulative error percentage (CEP) is 92.28\% and for 21 subjects participating in exercise tasks, the best CEP is 82.61\%. The results show the proposed method is promising in estimating SBP using PTT. Additionally, removing PEP from PAT leads to improving results by around 9\%. The CWR sensors present a low-power, continuous and potentially wearable system with minimal body contact to monitor aortic valve mechanical activities directly. Results of this study, of wearable radar sensors, demonstrate the potential superiority of CWR-based PEP extraction for various medical monitoring applications, including BP measurement.},

BPT has been shown to improve BP control compared to usual care without remote monitoring. Traditionally, a cuff-based monitor with data communication capabilities has been used for BPT; however, cuff-based measurements are inconvenient and cause discomfort, which has prevented the widespread use of cuff-based monitors for BPT. The development of new technologies which allow for remote BP monitoring without the use of a cuff may aid in more extensive adoption of BPT. This would enhance patient autonomy while providing physicians with a more complete picture of their patient's BP profile, potentially leading to improved BP control and better long-term clinical outcomes. This mini-review article aims to: (1) describe the fundamentals of current techniques in cuff-less BP measurement; (2) present examples of commercially available cuff-less technologies for BPT; (3) outline challenges with current methodologies; and (4) describe potential future directions in cuff-less BPT development.},

   abstract = {Goal: Although photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals can be used to estimate blood pressure (BP) by extracting various features, the changes in morphological contours of both PPG and ECG signals due to various diseases of circulatory system and interaction of other physiological systems make the extraction of such features very difficult. Methods: In this work, we propose a waveform-based hierarchical Artificial Neural Network - Long Short Term Memory (ANN-LSTM) model for BP estimation. The model consists of two hierarchy levels, where the lower hierarchy level uses ANNs to extract necessary morphological features from ECG and PPG waveforms and the upper hierarchy level uses LSTM layers to account for the time domain variation of the features extracted by lower hierarchy level. Results: The proposed model is evaluated on 39 subjects using the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentations (AAMI) standard and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard. The method satisfies both the standards in the estimation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). For the proposed network, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) for SBP estimation are 1.10 and 1.56 mmHg, respectively, and for DBP estimation are 0.58 and 0.85 mmHg, respectively. Conclusion: The performance of the proposed hierarchical ANN-LSTM model is found to be better than the other feature engineering-based networks. It is shown that the proposed model is able to automatically extract the necessary features and their time domain variations to estimate BP reliably in a noninvasive continuous manner. Significance: The method is expected to greatly facilitate the presently available mobile health-care gadgets in continuous BP estimation.},

Traditional blood pressure measurement techniques are either invasive or cuff-based, which are impractical, intermittent, and uncomfortable for patients. Over the past few decades, several indirect approaches using photoplethysmogram (PPG) have been investigated, namely, pulse transit time, pulse wave velocity, pulse arrival time and pulse wave analysis, in an effort to utilise PPG for estimating blood pressure.

In the diagnosis and assessment of hypertension, automated office blood pressure, taken without patient-health provider interaction, is now recommended as the preferred method of measuring in-office blood pressure. Also, although a serum lipid panel remains part of the routine laboratory testing for patients with hypertension, fasting and nonfasting collections are now considered acceptable. For individuals with secondary hypertension arising from primary hyperaldosteronism, adrenal vein sampling is recommended for those who are candidates for potential adrenalectomy. With respect to the treatment of hypertension, a new recommendation that has been added is for increasing dietary potassium to reduce blood pressure in those who are not at high risk for hyperkalemia. Furthermore, in selected high-risk patients, intensive blood pressure reduction to a target systolic blood pressure ≤ 120 mm Hg should be considered to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events. Finally, in hypertensive individuals with uncomplicated, stable angina pectoris, either a β-blocker or calcium channel blocker may be considered for initial therapy. The specific evidence and rationale underlying each of these recommendations are discussed.

   abstract = {This review portrays how ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was established and recommended as the method of choice for the assessment of BP and for the rational use of antihypertensive drugs. To establish much-needed diagnostic ambulatory BP thresholds, initial statistical approaches evolved into longitudinal studies of patients and populations, which demonstrated that cardiovascular complications are more closely associated with 24-hour and nighttime BP than with office BP. Studies cross-classifying individuals based on ambulatory and office BP thresholds identified white-coat hypertension, an elevated office BP in the presence of ambulatory normotension as a low-risk condition, whereas its counterpart, masked hypertension, carries a hazard almost as high as ambulatory combined with office hypertension. What clinically matters most is the level of the 24-hour and the nighttime BP, while other BP indexes derived from 24-hour ambulatory BP recordings, on top of the 24-hour and nighttime BP level, add little to risk stratification or hypertension management. Ambulatory BP monitoring is cost-effective. Ambulatory and home BP monitoring are complimentary approaches. Their interchangeability provides great versatility in the clinical implementation of out-of-office BP measurement. We are still waiting for evidence from randomized clinical trials to prove that out-of-office BP monitoring is superior to office BP in adjusting antihypertensive drug treatment and in the prevention of cardiovascular complications. A starting research line, the development of a standardized validation protocol for wearable BP monitoring devices, might facilitate the clinical applicability of ambulatory BP monitoring.},

   abstract = {A novel method for the continual, cuff-less estimation of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values based on signal complexity analysis of the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and the electrocardiogram (ECG) is reported. The proposed framework estimates the blood pressure (BP) values obtained from signals generated from 14 volunteers subjected to a series of exercise routines. Herein, the physiological signals were first pre-processed, followed by the extraction of complexity features from both the PPG and ECG. Subsequently the complexity features were used in regression models (artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and LASSO) to predict the BP. The performance of the approach was evaluated by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE) and the standard deviation (STD) of the predicted results and compared with the recommendations made by the British Hypertension Society (BHS) and Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). Complexity features from the ECG and PPG were investigated independently, along with the combined dataset. It was observed that the complexity features obtained from the combination of ECG and PPG signals resulted to an improved estimation accuracy for the BP. The most accurate DBP result of 5.15 ± 6.46 mmHg was obtained from ANN model, and SVM generated the most accurate prediction for the SBP which was estimated as 7.33 ± 9.53 mmHg. Results for DBP fall within recommended performance of the BHS but SBP is outside the range. Although initial results are promising, further improvements are required before the potential of this approach is fully realised.},

   abstract = {Accurate automatic noninvasive assessment of blood pressure (BP) presents a challenge due to conditions like arrhythmias, obesity, and postural changes that tend to obfuscate arterial amplitude pulsations sensed by the cuff. Researchers tried to overcome this challenge by analyzing oscillometric pulses with the aid of a higher fidelity signalthe electrocardiogram (ECG). Moreover, pulse transit time (PTT) was employed to provide an additional method for BP estimation. However, these methods were not fully developed, suitably integrated, or tested. To address these issues, we present a novel method whereby ECG-assisted oscillometric and PTT (measured between ECG R-peaks and maximum slope of arterial pulse peaks) analyses are seamlessly integrated into the oscillometric BP measurement paradigm. The method bolsters oscillometric analysis (amplitude modulation) with more reliable ECG R-peaks provides a complementary measure with PTT analysis (temporal modulation) and fuses this information for robust BP estimation. We have integrated this technology into a prototype that comprises a BP cuff with an embedded conductive fabric ECG electrode, associated hardware, and algorithms. A pilot study has been undertaken on ten healthy subjects (150 recordings) to validate the performance of our prototype against United States Food and Drug Administration approved Omron oscillometric monitor (HEM-790IT). Our prototype achieves mean absolute difference of less than 5 mmHg and grade A as per the British Hypertension Society protocol for estimating BP, with the reference Omron monitor. © 2011 IEEE.},

Based on BCG signal and PPG signal, a time delay between these two signals is obtained to calculate both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure via linear regression analysis. The fabricated noninvasive blood pressure monitoring device consists of a fiber sensor mat to measure BCG signal and a SpO2 sensor to measure PPG signal. A commercial digital oscillometric blood pressure meter is used to obtain reference values and for calibration. It has been found that by comparing with the reference device, our prototype has typical means and standard deviations of 9+/-5.6mmHg for systolic blood pressure, 1.8+/-1.3mmHg for diastolic blood pressure and 0.6+/-0.9bpm for pulse rate, respectively. If the fiber optic SpO2 probe is used, this new all fiber cuffless noninvasive blood pressure monitoring device will truly be a MRI safe blood pressure measurement and monitoring device. © 2013 IEEE.},

Objective is to measured different parameters that are heart rate, respiratory rate, BP. PPG signal is acquired by PPG sensor, microcontroller and RS 232. The acquired PPG signal is displayed in MATLAB. Frequency domain analysis of PPG signal shows a two peaks first at around 0.25 to 0.35 Hz and second at around 1 to 1.5 Hz. FFT at 1Hz relates to 60 BPM and FFT at 0.25 Hz relates to 15 respiratory cycles per minute. For BP Measurement, the pulse height of PPG is proportional to the difference between the systolic and the diastolic pressure in the arteries. The standard blood pressure monitoring instrument is used to calculate correlation coefficient. The arterial blood pressure is calculated based on these coefficients. PPG signal is used to detect blood pressure pulsations in a finger and achieved an accuracy of (0.8 ± 7) mmHg and (0.9 ± 6) mmHg for systolic and diastolic pressure, respectively. The developed PPG based method can be used as a noninvasive alternative to the conventional occluding-cuff approaches for long-term and continuous monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate.},

@article{Ding2016,
   abstract = {Pulse transit time (PTT) has attracted much interest for cuffless blood pressure (BP) measurement. However, its limited accuracy is one of the main problems preventing its widespread acceptance. Arterial BP oscillates mainly at high frequency (HF) because of respiratory activity, and at low frequency (LF) because of vasomotor tone. Prior studies suggested that PTT can track BP variation in HF range, but was inadequate to follow the LF variation, which is probably the main reason for its unsatisfactory accuracy. This paper presents a new indicator, the photoplethysmogram intensity ratio (PIR), which can be affected by changes in the arterial diameter, and, thus, trace the LF variation of BP. Spectral analysis of BP, PTT, PIR, and respiratory signal confirmed that PTT was related to BP in HF at the respiratory frequency, while PIR was associated with BP in LF range. We, therefore, develop a novel BP estimation algorithm by using both PTT and PIR. The proposed algorithm was validated on 27 healthy subjects with continuous Finapres BP as reference. The results showed that the mean ± standard deviation (SD) for the estimated systolic, diastolic, and mean BP with the proposed method against reference were -0.37 ± 5.21, -0.08 ± 4.06, -0.18 ± 4.13 mmHg, and mean absolute difference (MAD) were 4.09, 3.18, 3.18 mmHg, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method outperformed the two most cited PTT algorithms for about 2 mmHg in SD and MAD. These results demonstrated that the proposed BP model using PIR and PTT can estimate continuous BP with improved accuracy.},

   abstract = {Noninvasive measurement of blood pressure by optical methods receives considerable interest, but the complexity of the measurement and the difficulty of adjusting parameters restrict applications. We develop a method for estimating the systolic and diastolic blood pressure using a single-point optical recording of a photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal. The estimation is data-driven, we use automated machine learning algorithms instead of mathematical models. Combining supervised learning with a discrete wavelet transform, the method is insensitive to minor irregularities in the PPG waveform, hence both pulse oximeters and smartphone cameras can record the signal. We evaluate the accuracy of the estimation on 78 samples from 65 subjects (40 male, 25 female, age 29±7) with no history of cardiovascular disease. The estimate for systolic blood pressure has a mean error 4.9±4.9 mm Hg, and 4.3±3.7 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure when using the oximeter-obtained PPG. The same values are 5.1±4.3 mm Hg and 4.6±4.3 mm Hg when using the phone-obtained PPG, comparing with A&D UA-767PBT result as gold standard. The simplicity of the method encourages ambulatory measurement, and given the ease of sharing the measured data, we expect a shift to data-oriented approaches deriving insight from ubiquitous mobile devices that will yield more accurate machine learning models in monitoring blood pressure.},

   abstract = {Recently a few methods have been proposed in the literature for non-invasive cuff-less estimation of systolic and diastolic blood pressures. One of the most prominent methods is to use the Pulse Transit Time (PTT). Although it is proven that PTT has a strong correlation with the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, this relation is highly dependent to each individuals physiological properties. Therefore, it requires per person calibration for accurate and reliable blood pressure estimation from PTT, which is a big drawback. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, a novel method is proposed for accurate and reliable estimation of blood pressure that is calibration-free. This goal is accomplished by extraction of several physiological parameters from Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal as well as utilizing signal processing and machine learning algorithms. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed method achieves grade B for the estimation of the diastolic blood pressure and grade C for the estimation of the mean arterial pressure under the standard British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol.},

This is especially true in critical care environments, where life-saving decisions may have to be made on the basis of signals from monitoring devices. Hemodynamic monitoring is essential in dialysis, surgery, and in critically ill patients. For the most severe patients, blood pressure is normally assessed through a catheter, which is an invasive procedure that may result in adverse effects. Blood pressure can also be monitored noninvasively through different methods and these data can be used for the continuous assessment of pressure using machine learning methods. Previous studies have found pulse transit time to be related to blood pressure. In this short paper, we propose to study the feasibility of implementing a data-driven model based on restricted Boltzmann machine artificial neural networks, delivering a first proof of concept for the validity and viability of a method for blood pressure prediction based on these models.

ABSTRACT = {Blood pressure (BP) monitoring has significant importance in the treatment of hypertension and different cardiovascular health diseases. As photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals can be recorded non-invasively, research has been highly conducted to measure BP using PPG recently. In this paper, we propose a U-net deep learning architecture that uses fingertip PPG signal as input to estimate arterial BP (ABP) waveform non-invasively. From this waveform, we have also measured systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 100 subjects from two publicly available databases: MIMIC and MIMIC-III. The predicted ABP waveforms correlated highly with the reference waveforms and we have obtained an average Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.993. The mean absolute error is 3.68 ± 4.42 mmHg for SBP, 1.97 ± 2.92 mmHg for DBP, and 2.17 ± 3.06 mmHg for MAP which satisfy the requirements of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard and obtain grade A according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard. The results show that the proposed method is an efficient process to estimate ABP waveform directly using fingertip PPG.},

   abstract = {Objective: Continuous blood pressure (BP) provides valuable information for the disease management of patients with arrhythmias. The traditional intra-arterial method is too invasive for routine healthcare settings, whereas cuff-based devices are inferior in reliability and comfortable for long-term BP monitoring during arrhythmias. The study aimed to investigate an indirect method for continuous and cuff-less BP estimation based on electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals during arrhythmias and to test its reliability for the determination of BP using invasive BP (IBP) as reference. Methods: Thirty-five clinically stable patients (15 with ventricular arrhythmias and 20 with supraventricular arrhythmias) who had undergone radiofrequency ablation were enrolled in this study. Their ECG, PPG, and femoral arterial IBP signals were simultaneously recorded with a multi-parameter monitoring system. Fifteen features that have the potential ability in indicating beat-to-beat BP changes during arrhythmias were extracted from the ECG and PPG signals. Four machine learning algorithms, decision tree regression (DTR), support vector machine regression (SVR), adaptive boosting regression (AdaboostR), and random forest regression (RFR), were then implemented to develop the BP models. Results: The results showed that the mean value ± standard deviation of root mean square error for the estimated systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) with the RFR model against the reference in all patients were 5.87 ± 3.13 and 3.52 ± 1.38 mmHg, respectively, which achieved the best performance among all the models. Furthermore, the mean error ± standard deviation of error between the estimated SBP and DBP with the RFR model against the reference in all patients were −0.04 ± 6.11 and 0.11 ± 3.62 mmHg, respectively, which complied with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation and the British Hypertension Society (Grade A) standards. Conclusion: The results indicated that the utilization of ECG and PPG signals has the potential to enable cuff-less and continuous BP estimation in an indirect way for patients with arrhythmias.},

   abstract = {The pulse arrival time (PAT), the difference between the R-peak time of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and the systolic peak of photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, is an indicator that enables noninvasive and continuous blood pressure estimation. However, it is difficult to accurately measure PAT from ECG and PPG signals because they have inconsistent shapes owing to patient-specific physical characteristics, pathological conditions, and movements. Accordingly, complex preprocessing is required to estimate blood pressure based on PAT. In this paper, as an alternative solution, we propose a noninvasive continuous algorithm using the difference between ECG and PPG as a new feature that can include PAT information. The proposed algorithm is a deep CNN–LSTM-based multitasking machine learning model that outputs simultaneous prediction results of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP). We used a total of 48 patients on the PhysioNet website by splitting them into 38 patients for training and 10 patients for testing. The prediction accuracies of SBP and DBP were 0.0 ± 1.6 mmHg and 0.2 ± 1.3 mmHg, respectively. Even though the proposed model was assessed with only 10 patients, this result was satisfied with three guidelines, which are the BHS, AAMI, and IEEE standards for blood pressure measurement devices.},

@report{Mohammad2019,
   abstract = {The continuous systolic and diastolic pressure have great medical value, especially for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases detection. Beside the inconvenience of cuff based blood pressure (BP) measurement devices, the lack of widely accepted accurate measurements and calibration, the BP portable devices are even less attractive. The pulse transit time (PTT) is related to arterial stiffness and can be used to estimate systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Considering the complex multivariate physiological processes in human body, depending on only PTT doesn't give acceptable accuracy. This study extends the pulse transit time (PTT) based cuff less BP measurement method to include the heart rate (HR) as an additional information. A new model based on linear regression is proposed that include the HR to measure the BP. PTT only BP and the proposed PTT and HR based BP measurement models are tested using MIMIC database. Using model including linear regression and curve fitting, it was shown that the proposed model reduced the BP root mean square error (RMSE) for SBP from 9.6 to 7.1 and for DBP from 4.2 to 3.1 compared to conventional PTT only based methods.},

@article{Fujita2019,
   abstract = {This paper proposes a cuFF-less systolic blood pressure (SBP) estimation method using partial least-squares (PLS) regression. Level-crossing features (LCFs) were used in this method, which were extracted from the contour lines arbitrarily drawn on the second-derivative photoplethysmography waveform. Unlike conventional height ratio features (HRFs), which are extracted on the basis of the peaks in the waveform, LCFs can be reliably extracted even if there are missing peaks in the waveform. However, the features extracted from adjacent contour lines show similar trends; thus, there is a strong correlation between the features, which leads to multicollinearity when conventional multiple regression analysis (MRA) is used. Hence, we developed a multivariate estimation method based on PLS regression to address this issue and estimate the SBP on the basis of the LCFs. Two-hundred-and-sixty-five subjects (95 males and 170 females [(Mean ± Standard Deviation) SBP: 133.1 ± 18.4 mmHg; age: 62.8 ± 16.8 years] participated in the experiments. Of the total number of subjects, 180 were considered as learning data, while 85 were considered as testing data. The values of the correlation coefficient between the measured and estimated values were found to be 0.78 for the proposed method (LCFs + PLS), 0.58 for comparison method 1 (HRFs + MRA), and 0.62 for comparison method 2 (HRFs + MRA). The proposed method was therefore found to demonstrate the highest accuracy among the three methods being compared.},

@article{Su2017,
   abstract = {Existing methods for arterial blood pressure (BP) estimation directly map the input physiological signals to output BP values without explicitly modeling the underlying temporal dependencies in BP dynamics. As a result, these models suffer from accuracy decay over a long time and thus require frequent calibration. In this work, we address this issue by formulating BP estimation as a sequence prediction problem in which both the input and target are temporal sequences. We propose a novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) consisting of multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are incorporated with (1) a bidirectional structure to access larger-scale context information of input sequence, and (2) residual connections to allow gradients in deep RNN to propagate more effectively. The proposed deep RNN model was tested on a static BP dataset, and it achieved root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.90 and 2.66 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) prediction respectively, surpassing the accuracy of traditional BP prediction models. On a multi-day BP dataset, the deep RNN achieved RMSE of 3.84, 5.25, 5.80 and 5.81 mmHg for the 1st day, 2nd day, 4th day and 6th month after the 1st day SBP prediction, and 1.80, 4.78, 5.0, 5.21 mmHg for corresponding DBP prediction, respectively, which outperforms all previous models with notable improvement. The experimental results suggest that modeling the temporal dependencies in BP dynamics significantly improves the long-term BP prediction accuracy.},
