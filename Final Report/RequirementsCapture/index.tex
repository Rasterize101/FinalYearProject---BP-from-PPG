\section{Requirements Capture (Overview of work)}
Projects with a deliverable that serves a specific
function often have an initial phase in which expected
use is investigated and a brief more detailed than the
specification is constructed. This would include what
is necessary, what is desirable, etc in the final
deliverable. The results of requirements capture
determine project objectives and are used to inform
project evaluation.\\ \newline \noindent Requirements capture is important in all projects with
real-world deliverables, and is often a significant
amount of work in software projects. Where
requirements capture is less relevant (for example in
an analytical 'research-style' project) this may be
replaced by a detailed description of the project aims
and objectives in the Introduction or the Background
sections.
