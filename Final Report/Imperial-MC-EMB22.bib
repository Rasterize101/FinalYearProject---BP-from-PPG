abstract = {While there exist many Monte Carlo (MC) programs for solving the radiative transfer equation (RTE) in biological tissues, we have identified a need for an open-source MC program that is sufficiently user-friendly for use in an education environment, in which detailed knowledge of compiling or UNIX command-line cannot be assumed. Therefore, we introduce MCmatlab, an open-source codebase thus far consisting of (a) a fast three-dimensional MC RTE solver and (b) a finite-element heat diffusion and Arrhenius-based thermal tissue damage simulator, both run in MATLAB. The kernel for both of these solvers is written in parallelized C and implemented as MATLAB MEX functions, combining the speed of C with the familiarity and versatility of MATLAB. We compare the RTE solver to Steven Jacques' mcxyz, which it is inspired by, and present example results generated by the thermal model. MCmatlab is easy to install and use and can be used by students and experienced researchers alike for simulating tissue light propagation and, optionally, thermal damage.},

abstract = {We have simulated diffuse reflectance spectra of skin by assuming a wavelength-independent scattering coefficient for the different skin tissues and using the known wavelength dependence of the absorption coefficient of oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin and water. A stochastic Monte Carlo method is used to convert the wavelength-dependent absorption coefficient and wavelength-independent scattering coefficient into reflected intensity. The absorption properties of skin tissues in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions are estimated by taking into account the spatial distribution of blood vessels, water and melanin content within distinct anatomical layers. The geometrical peculiarities of skin histological structure, degree of blood oxygenation and the haematocrit index are also taken into account. We demonstrate that when the model is supplied with reasonable physical and structural parameters of skin, the results of the simulation agree reasonably well with the results of in vivo measurements of skin spectra.},

abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE: Colorectal cancer is one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Surgical removal of the cancerous growth is the primary treatment for this disease. A colorectal cancer surgery, however, is often unsuccessful due to the anastomotic failure that may occur following the surgical incision. Prevention of an anastomotic failure requires continuous monitoring of intestinal tissue viability during and after colorectal surgery. To date, no clinical technology exists for the dynamic and continuous monitoring of the intestinal perfusion. AIM: A dual-wavelength indwelling bowel photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor for the continuous monitoring of intestinal viability was proposed and characterized through a set of in silico and in vivo investigations. APPROACH: The in silico investigation was based on a Monte Carlo model that was executed to quantify the variables such as penetration depth and detected intensity with respect to the sensor-tissue separations and tissue perfusion. Utilizing the simulated information, an indwelling reflectance PPG sensor was designed and tested on 20 healthy volunteers. Two sets of in vivo studies were performed using the driving current intensities 20 and 40 mA for a comparative analysis, using buccal tissue as a proxy tissue-site. RESULTS: Both simulated and experimental results showed the efficacy of the sensor to acquire good signals through the "contact" to a "noncontact" separation of 5 mm. A very slow wavelength-dependent variation was shown in the detected intensity at the normal and hypoxic states of the tissue, whereas a decay in the intensity was found with the increasing submucosal-blood volume. The simulated detected-to-incident-photon-ratio and the experimental signal-to-noise ratio exhibited strong positive correlations, with the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient R ranging between 0.65 and 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: The detailed feasibility analysis presented will lead to clinical trials utilizing the proposed sensor.},

abstract = {Objective To evaluate the normal thickness of the thyrohyoid muscle, which is one of the key muscles related to swallowing, by ultrasonography. Methods The thickness of the left and right thyrohyoid muscles was measured in normal male and female adults ranging in age from 20 to 79 years by ultrasonography. The groups were classified according to age as follows: subjects ranging in age from 20 to 39 years were classified into group A, subjects ranging in age from 40 to 59 years were classified into group B, and subjects ranging in age from 60 to 79 years were classified into group C. The measurement level was the line that joins the upper tip of the superior thyroid notch and the oblique line of the thyroid cartilage. Also, a correlation with the thyrohyoid muscle was investigated by collecting information regarding height, weight, body mass index (BMI), age, and gender of subjects in the healthy group. Results The number of subjects in each group was as follows: group A (n=82), group B (n=62), and group C (n=60). Also, the thicknesses of the left and right muscles were 2.72±0.65 mm and 2.87±0.76 mm in group A, 2.83±0.61 mm and 2.93±0.67 mm in group B, and 2.59±054 mm and 2.73±0.55 mm in group C, respectively. Thyrohyoid muscle had a correlation with height, weight, and BMI. The thickness of the left and right thyrohyoid muscles was greater in male subjects than in female subjects and the right side muscle was thicker than the left side muscle. Conclusion The average thickness of the left and right thyrohyoid muscles was 3.20±0.54 mm in male subjects and 2.34±0.37 mm in female subjects. The thickness of the thyrohyoid muscle was positively correlated with height, weight, and BMI, and the thyrohyoid muscle was thicker in male subjects than in female subjects and the right side muscle was thicker than the left side muscle.},

abstract = {Objective: The neck is a very attractive measurement location for multimodal physiological monitoring, since it offers the possibility of extracting clinically relevant parameters, which cannot be obtained from other body locations, such as lung volumes. It is for this reason that obtaining PPG from the neck would be of interest. PPG signals, however, are very susceptible to artifacts which greatly compromise their quality. But the extent of this is going to depend on, the nature of the artifacts and the strength of the sensed signal, both of which are location dependent. This paper presents for the first time the characterization of artifacts affecting neck PPG signals. Methods: Neck PPG data was recorded from 19 participants, who performed ten different activities to deliberately introduce common artifacts. 41 PPG features were extracted and statistically analyzed to investigate which ones showed the greatest ability to differentiate normal PPG from each artifact. A customized minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) feature selection approach was implemented, to select the top 10 features. Results: Artifacts caused by Swallowing, Yawning and Coughing exhibited larger Spectral Entropy, Average Power and smaller Spectral Kurtosis, than normal PPG. Head movement artifacts, also demonstrated highly disordered and noisy frequency spectra, and were characterized by having larger and irregular time domain features. In addition, the analysis showed that different respiratory states that could be of clinical interests, such as presence of apneas, were also distinguishable from sources of interference. Significance: These findings are important for the development of PPG denoising algorithms and subsequent obtention of biomarkers of interest, or alternatively for applications where the events of interest are the artifacts themselves.},

A multilayer Monte Carlo model of a healthy human colon has been developed to investigate the light-tissue behavior during different perfusion states within the mucosal layer of the colon. Results from a static multilayer model of optical path and reflectance at two wavelengths, 660 nm and 880 nm, through colon tissue, containing different volume fractions of blood with a fixed oxygen saturation are presented. The effect on the optical path and penetration depth with varying blood volumes within the mucosa for each wavelength has been demonstrated. The simulation indicated both wavelengths of photons penetrated similar depths, entering the muscularis layer.},

abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an uncomplicated and inexpensive optical measurement method that is often used for heart rate monitoring purposes. PPG is a non-invasive technology that uses a light source and a photodetector at the surface of skin to measure the volumetric variations of blood circulation. Recently, there has been much interest from numerous researchers around the globe to extract further valuable information from the PPG signal in addition to heart rate estimation and pulse oxymetry readings. PPG signal's second derivative wave contains important health-related information. Thus, analysis of this waveform can help researchers and clinicians to evaluate various cardiovascular-related diseases such as atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness. Moreover, investigating the second derivative wave of PPG signal can also assist in early detection and diagnosis of various cardiovascular illnesses that may possibly appear later in life. For early recognition and analysis of such illnesses, continuous and real-time monitoring is an important approach that has been enabled by the latest technological advances in sensor technology and wireless communications. The aim of this article is to briefly consider some of the current developments and challenges of wearable PPG-based monitoring technologies and then to discuss some of the potential applications of this technology in clinical settings.},

abstract = {Diffuse optical tomography using near-infrared light in a wavelength range from 700 to 1000 nm has the potential to enable non-invasive diagnoses of thyroid cancers; some of which are difficult to detect by conventional methods such as ultrasound tomography. Diffuse optical tomography needs to be based on a physically accurate model of light propagation in the neck, because it reconstructs tomographic images of the optical properties in the human neck by inverse analysis. Our objective here was to investigate the effects of three factors on light propagation in the neck using the 2D time-dependent radiative transfer equation: (1) the presence of the trachea, (2) the refractive-index mismatch at the trachea-tissue interface, and (3) the effect of neck organs other than the trachea (spine, spinal cord, and blood vessels). There was a significant influence of reflection and refraction at the trachea-tissue interface on the light intensities in the region between the trachea and the front of the neck surface. Organs other than the trachea showed little effect on the light intensities measured at the front of the neck surface although these organs affected the light intensities locally. These results indicated the necessity of modeling the refractive-index mismatch at the trachea-tissue interface and the possibility of modeling other neck organs simply as a homogeneous medium when the source and detectors were far from large blood vessels.},

abstract = {Continuous overnight vital signs monitoring would be ideal for patients suffering from epilepsy, where life-threatening hypoxemias can occur during sleep. However, the existing physiological monitoring systems suffer from limitations in terms of usability factors and/or limited information of the signals being acquired. The body location of the monitoring system is a crucial consideration, seldom addressed by the wider community. This article presents a proof-of-concept, neck-worn photoplethysmography system, which was developed and tested to assess the feasibility of the neck as a monitoring site for longitudinal sensing of cardiac and respiratory responses during sleep. The novel system was compared against a gold-standard commercial multichannel cardiorespiratory polysomnography (PSG) system during oxygen desaturation cycles, to assess its ability to measure heart rate, respiratory rate (RR), and peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) on 15 participants. The findings for heart rate showed a marginal mean error of 0.47 beats/min with limits of agreement (LOA) at 95% confidence between -3.17 and 4 bpm. RR comparisons had an overall mean error of 0.43 breaths/min, with LOA at 95% confidence between -2.73 and 3.3 bpm. Lastly, the system accurately outputs SpO2 with an overall root-mean-square error of 1.44% between 90 and 100% SpO2 using a custom calibration method. Moreover, it was observed that the neck made it possible for the system to detect desaturation events on an average 12.6 s prior to the PSG system, which used a peripheral finger-based PPG system. Ultimately, this proof-of-concept study illustrates the viability of neck-based sensing for minimally invasive monitoring of cardiac and respiratory vitals during sleep.},

abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an optical noninvasive technique with the potential for assessing tissue perfusion. The relative time-change in the concentration of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin in the blood can be derived from DC part of the PPG signal. However, the absolute concentration cannot be determined due to the inadequate data on PPG optical paths. The optical path and differential pathlength factor (DPF) for PPG at red (660 nm) and infrared (880 nm) wavelengths were investigated using a heterogeneous Monte Carlo model of the human forearm. Using the simulated DPFs, the absolute time-change in concentrations were determined from PPG signals recorded from the same tissue site. Results were compared with three conditions of approximated DPFs. Results showed the variation of the optical-path and DPF with different wavelengths and source–detector separations. Approximations resulted in significant errors, for example, using NIRS DPF in PPG led to “cross talk” of −0.4297 and 0.060 and an error of 15.16% to 25.18%. Results confirmed the feasibility of using the PPG (DC) for the assessment of tissue perfusion. The study also identified the inappropriateness of the assumption that DPF is independent of wavelength or source–detector separations and set the platform for further studies on investigating optical pathlengths and DPF in PPG.},

abstract = {Background and objectives Intermittent vital signs measurements are the current standard on hospital wards, typically recorded once every 8 hours. Early signs of deterioration may therefore be missed. Recent innovations have resulted in 'wearable' sensors, which may capture patient deterioration at an earlier stage. The objective of this study was to determine whether a wireless ' patch' sensor is able to reliably measure respiratory and heart rate continuously in high-risk surgical patients. The secondary objective was to explore the potential of the wireless sensor to serve as a safety monitor. Design In an observational methods comparisons study, patients were measured with both the wireless sensor and bedside routine standard for at least 24 hours. Setting University teaching hospital, single centre. Participants Twenty-five postoperative surgical patients admitted to a step-down unit. Outcome measures Primary outcome measures were limits of agreement and bias of heart rate and respiratory rate. Secondary outcome measures were sensor reliability, defined as time until first occurrence of data loss. Results 1568 hours of vital signs data were analysed. Bias and 95% limits of agreement for heart rate were '1.1 ('8.8 to 6.5) beats per minute. For respiration rate, bias was '2.3 breaths per minute with wide limits of agreement ('15.8 to 11.2 breaths per minute). Median filtering over a 15 min period improved limits of agreement of both respiration and heart rate. 63% of the measurements were performed without data loss greater than 2 min. Overall data loss was limited (6% of time). Conclusions The wireless sensor is capable of accurately measuring heart rate, but accuracy for respiratory rate was outside acceptable limits. Remote monitoring has the potential to contribute to early recognition of physiological decline in high-risk patients. Future studies should focus on the ability to detect patient deterioration on low care environments and at home after discharge.},
