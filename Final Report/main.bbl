    \field{abstract}{%
    Blood pressure (BP) is one of the most important monitoring parameters in
  clinical medicine. For years, the cuff-based sphygmomanometer and the
  arterial invasive line have been the gold standards for care professionals to
  assess BP. During the past few decades, the wide spread of the
  oscillometry-based BP arm or wrist cuffs have made home-based BP assessment
  more convenient and accessible. However, the discontinuous nature, the
  inability to interface with mobile applications, the relative inaccuracy with
  movement, and the need for calibration have rendered those BP oscillometry
  devices inadequate for next-generation healthcare infrastructure where
  integration and continuous data acquisition and communication are required.
  Recently, the indirect approach to obtain BP values has been intensively
  investigated, where BP is mathematically derived through the “Time Delay”
  in propagation of pressure waves in the vascular system. This holds promise
  for the realization of cuffless and continuous BP monitoring systems, for
  both patients and healthy populations in both inpatient and outpatient
  settings. This review highlights recent efforts in developing these
  next-generation blood pressure monitoring devices and compares various
  mathematical models. The unmet challenges and further developments that are
  crucial to develop “Time Delay”-based BP devices are also discussed.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Background: Blood pressure (BP) measurements have been used widely in
  clinical and private environments. Recently, the use of ECG monitors has
  proliferated; however, they are not enabled with BP estimation. We have
  developed a method for BP estimation using only electrocardiogram (ECG)
  signals. Methods: Raw ECG data are filtered and segmented, and, following
  this, a complexity analysis is performed for feature extraction. Then, a
  machine-learning method is applied, combining a stacking-based classification
  module and a regression module for building systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP
  (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) predictive models. In addition, the
  method allows a probability distribution-based calibration to adapt the
  models to a particular user. Results: Using ECG recordings from 51 different
  subjects, 3129 30-s ECG segments are constructed, and seven features are
  extracted. Using a train-validation-test evaluation, the method achieves a
  mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.64 mmHg for SBP, 18.20 mmHg for DBP, and 13.52
  mmHg for the MAP prediction. When models are calibrated, the MAE decreases to
  7.72 mmHg for SBP, 9.45 mmHg for DBP and 8.13 mmHg for MAP. Conclusion: The
  experimental results indicate that, when a probability distribution-based
  calibration is used, the proposed method can achieve results close to those
  of a certified medical device for BP estimation.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Hypertension is an important public health issue due to its association
  with a number of serious diseases, including cardiovascular disease and
  stroke. The importance of evaluating hypertension taking into account
  different blood pressure (BP) profiles and BP variability (BPV) is
  increasingly being recognized, and is particularly relevant in Asian
  populations given the specific features of hypertension in the region
  (including greater salt sensitivity and a high rate of nocturnal
  hypertension). Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) is the gold standard for
  diagnosing hypertension and assessing 24-hour BP and provides data on several
  important parameters that cannot be obtained using any other form of BP
  measurement. In addition, ABPM parameters provide better information on
  cardio- and cerebrovascular risk than office BP. ABPM should be used in all
  patients with elevated BP, particularly those with unstable office or home
  BP, or who are suspected to have white-coat or masked hypertension. ABPM is
  also an important part of hypertension diagnosis and monitoring in high-risk
  patients. ABPM needs to be performed using a validated device and good
  practice techniques, and has a role both in hypertension diagnosis and in
  monitoring the response to antihypertensive therapy to ensure strict BP
  control throughout the 24-hour period. Use of ABPM in clinical practice may
  be limited by cost and accessibility, and practical education of physicians
  and patients is essential. The ABPM evidence and practice points in this
  document are based on the Hypertension Cardiovascular Outcome Prevention and
  Evidence (HOPE) Asia Network expert panel consensus recommendations for ABPM
  in Asia.%

    The pulse arrival time (PAT), pre-ejection period (PEP) and pulse transit
  time (PTT) are calculated using on-body continuous wave radar (CWR),
  Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors for wearable
  continuous systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements. The CWR and PPG
  sensors are placed on the sternum and left earlobe respectively. This paper
  presents a signal processing method based on wavelet transform and adaptive
  filtering to remove noise from CWR signals. Experimental data are collected
  from 43 subjects in various static postures and 26 subjects doing 6 different
  exercise tasks. Two mathematical models are used to calculate SBPs from
  PTTs/PATs. For 38 subjects participating in posture tasks, the best
  cumulative error percentage (CEP) is 92.28\% and for 21 subjects
  participating in exercise tasks, the best CEP is 82.61\%. The results show
  the proposed method is promising in estimating SBP using PTT. Additionally,
  removing PEP from PAT leads to improving results by around 9\%. The CWR
  sensors present a low-power, continuous and potentially wearable system with
  minimal body contact to monitor aortic valve mechanical activities directly.
  Results of this study, of wearable radar sensors, demonstrate the potential
  superiority of CWR-based PEP extraction for various medical monitoring
  applications, including BP measurement.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Blood pressure telemonitoring (BPT) is a telemedicine strategy that uses a
  patient's self-measured blood pressure (BP) and transmits this information to
  healthcare providers, typically over the internet. BPT has been shown to
  improve BP control compared to usual care without remote monitoring.
  Traditionally, a cuff-based monitor with data communication capabilities has
  been used for BPT; however, cuff-based measurements are inconvenient and
  cause discomfort, which has prevented the widespread use of cuff-based
  monitors for BPT. The development of new technologies which allow for remote
  BP monitoring without the use of a cuff may aid in more extensive adoption of
  BPT. This would enhance patient autonomy while providing physicians with a
  more complete picture of their patient's BP profile, potentially leading to
  improved BP control and better long-term clinical outcomes. This mini-review
  article aims to: (1) describe the fundamentals of current techniques in
  cuff-less BP measurement; (2) present examples of commercially available
  cuff-less technologies for BPT; (3) outline challenges with current
  methodologies; and (4) describe potential future directions in cuff-less BPT
  development.%

    Goal: Although photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals
  can be used to estimate blood pressure (BP) by extracting various features,
  the changes in morphological contours of both PPG and ECG signals due to
  various diseases of circulatory system and interaction of other physiological
  systems make the extraction of such features very difficult. Methods: In this
  work, we propose a waveform-based hierarchical Artificial Neural Network -
  Long Short Term Memory (ANN-LSTM) model for BP estimation. The model consists
  of two hierarchy levels, where the lower hierarchy level uses ANNs to extract
  necessary morphological features from ECG and PPG waveforms and the upper
  hierarchy level uses LSTM layers to account for the time domain variation of
  the features extracted by lower hierarchy level. Results: The proposed model
  is evaluated on 39 subjects using the Association for the Advancement of
  Medical Instrumentations (AAMI) standard and the British Hypertension Society
  (BHS) standard. The method satisfies both the standards in the estimation of
  systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). For the
  proposed network, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square
  error (RMSE) for SBP estimation are 1.10 and 1.56 mmHg, respectively, and for
  DBP estimation are 0.58 and 0.85 mmHg, respectively. Conclusion: The
  performance of the proposed hierarchical ANN-LSTM model is found to be better
  than the other feature engineering-based networks. It is shown that the
  proposed model is able to automatically extract the necessary features and
  their time domain variations to estimate BP reliably in a noninvasive
  continuous manner. Significance: The method is expected to greatly facilitate
  the presently available mobile health-care gadgets in continuous BP
  estimation.%

    The recent advancement on wearable physiological sensors supports the
  development of real-time diagnosis in preventive medicine that demands
  various signal processing techniques to enable the extraction of the vital
  signs (e.g., blood pressure). Blood pressure estimation from physiological
  sensors data is challenging task that usually is solved by a combination of
  multiple signals. In this paper we present a novel complexity analysis-based
  machine-learning perspective on the problem of blood pressure class
  estimation only from ECG signals. We show that high classification accuracy
  of 96.68\% can be achieved by extracting information via complexity analysis
  on the ECG signal followed by applying a stack of machine-learning
  classifiers. In addition, the proposed stacking approach is compared to a
  traditional machine-learning approaches and feature analysis is performed to
  determine the influence of the different features on the classification
  accuracy. The experimental data was gathered by daily monitoring of 20
  subjects with two different ECG sensors.%

    This review portrays how ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was
  established and recommended as the method of choice for the assessment of BP
  and for the rational use of antihypertensive drugs. To establish much-needed
  diagnostic ambulatory BP thresholds, initial statistical approaches evolved
  into longitudinal studies of patients and populations, which demonstrated
  that cardiovascular complications are more closely associated with 24-hour
  and nighttime BP than with office BP. Studies cross-classifying individuals
  based on ambulatory and office BP thresholds identified white-coat
  hypertension, an elevated office BP in the presence of ambulatory
  normotension as a low-risk condition, whereas its counterpart, masked
  hypertension, carries a hazard almost as high as ambulatory combined with
  office hypertension. What clinically matters most is the level of the 24-hour
  and the nighttime BP, while other BP indexes derived from 24-hour ambulatory
  BP recordings, on top of the 24-hour and nighttime BP level, add little to
  risk stratification or hypertension management. Ambulatory BP monitoring is
  cost-effective. Ambulatory and home BP monitoring are complimentary
  approaches. Their interchangeability provides great versatility in the
  clinical implementation of out-of-office BP measurement. We are still waiting
  for evidence from randomized clinical trials to prove that out-of-office BP
  monitoring is superior to office BP in adjusting antihypertensive drug
  treatment and in the prevention of cardiovascular complications. A starting
  research line, the development of a standardized validation protocol for
  wearable BP monitoring devices, might facilitate the clinical applicability
  of ambulatory BP monitoring.%

    Blood pressure (BP) monitoring has significant importance in the treatment
  of hypertension and different cardiovascular health diseases. As
  photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals can be recorded non-invasively, research has
  been highly conducted to measure BP using PPG recently. In this paper, we
  propose a U-net deep learning architecture that uses fingertip PPG signal as
  input to estimate arterial BP (ABP) waveform non-invasively. From this
  waveform, we have also measured systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and
  mean arterial pressure (MAP). The proposed method was evaluated on a subset
  of 100 subjects from two publicly available databases: MIMIC and MIMIC-III.
  The predicted ABP waveforms correlated highly with the reference waveforms
  and we have obtained an average Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.993.
  The mean absolute error is 3.68 ± 4.42 mmHg for SBP, 1.97 ± 2.92 mmHg for
  DBP, and 2.17 ± 3.06 mmHg for MAP which satisfy the requirements of the
  Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard
  and obtain grade A according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS)
  standard. The results show that the proposed method is an efficient process
  to estimate ABP waveform directly using fingertip PPG.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Hypertension or high blood pressure is a leading cause of death throughout
  the world and a critical factor for increasing the risk of serious diseases,
  including cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and heart failure. Blood
  pressure is a primary vital sign that must be monitored regularly for the
  early detection, prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
  Traditional blood pressure measurement techniques are either invasive or
  cuff-based, which are impractical, intermittent, and uncomfortable for
  patients. Over the past few decades, several indirect approaches using
  photoplethysmogram (PPG) have been investigated, namely, pulse transit time,
  pulse wave velocity, pulse arrival time and pulse wave analysis, in an effort
  to utilise PPG for estimating blood pressure. Recent advancements in signal
  processing techniques, including machine learning and artificial
  intelligence, have also opened up exciting new horizons for PPG-based cuff
  less and continuous monitoring of blood pressure. Such a device will have a
  significant and transformative impact in monitoring patients’ vital signs,
  especially those at risk of cardiovascular disease. This paper provides a
  comprehensive review for non-invasive cuff-less blood pressure estimation
  using the PPG approach along with their challenges and limitations.%

  Task Force provides annually updated, evidence-based recommendations to guide
  the diagnosis, assessment, prevention, and treatment of hypertension. This
  year, we present 4 new recommendations, as well as revisions to 2 previous
  recommendations. In the diagnosis and assessment of hypertension, automated
  office blood pressure, taken without patient-health provider interaction, is
  now recommended as the preferred method of measuring in-office blood
  pressure. Also, although a serum lipid panel remains part of the routine
  laboratory testing for patients with hypertension, fasting and nonfasting
  collections are now considered acceptable. For individuals with secondary
  hypertension arising from primary hyperaldosteronism, adrenal vein sampling
  is recommended for those who are candidates for potential adrenalectomy. With
  respect to the treatment of hypertension, a new recommendation that has been
  added is for increasing dietary potassium to reduce blood pressure in those
  who are not at high risk for hyperkalemia. Furthermore, in selected high-risk
  patients, intensive blood pressure reduction to a target systolic blood
  pressure ≤ 120 mm Hg should be considered to decrease the risk of
  cardiovascular events. Finally, in hypertensive individuals with
  uncomplicated, stable angina pectoris, either a β-blocker or calcium channel
  blocker may be considered for initial therapy. The specific evidence and
  rationale underlying each of these recommendations are discussed.
  Hypertension Canada's Canadian Hypertension Education Program Guidelines Task
  Force will continue to provide annual updates.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In the current study, we found the relationship between blood pressure (BP)
  and pulse transit time (PTT). After measuring ECG and photoplethysmogram, the
  PTT was calculated from the acquired signals. Blood pressure (BP), the
  pressure exerted by circulating blood upon the walls of blood vessels, is an
  important physiological parameter and can provide some information for
  personal healthcare. Pulse transit time is the time taken for the arterial
  pulse Pressure wave to travel from the aortic valve to a peripheral site. It
  is usually measured from the R wave on the electrocardiogram to a
  photoplethysmography signal. PTT is inversely proportional to blood pressure.
  The mean error are 0.29 mmHg for SBP and 0.1mmHg for DBP. These results are
  satisfied with the regulation of ANSI/AAMI for certification of
  sphygmomanometer that real measurement error value should be within the mean
  error of ±5mmHg.%

    Objective: Continuous blood pressure (BP) provides valuable information for
  the disease management of patients with arrhythmias. The traditional
  intra-arterial method is too invasive for routine healthcare settings,
  whereas cuff-based devices are inferior in reliability and comfortable for
  long-term BP monitoring during arrhythmias. The study aimed to investigate an
  indirect method for continuous and cuff-less BP estimation based on
  electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals during
  arrhythmias and to test its reliability for the determination of BP using
  invasive BP (IBP) as reference. Methods: Thirty-five clinically stable
  patients (15 with ventricular arrhythmias and 20 with supraventricular
  arrhythmias) who had undergone radiofrequency ablation were enrolled in this
  study. Their ECG, PPG, and femoral arterial IBP signals were simultaneously
  recorded with a multi-parameter monitoring system. Fifteen features that have
  the potential ability in indicating beat-to-beat BP changes during
  arrhythmias were extracted from the ECG and PPG signals. Four machine
  learning algorithms, decision tree regression (DTR), support vector machine
  regression (SVR), adaptive boosting regression (AdaboostR), and random forest
  regression (RFR), were then implemented to develop the BP models. Results:
  The results showed that the mean value ± standard deviation of root mean
  square error for the estimated systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) with the
  RFR model against the reference in all patients were 5.87 ± 3.13 and 3.52 ±
  1.38 mmHg, respectively, which achieved the best performance among all the
  models. Furthermore, the mean error ± standard deviation of error between
  the estimated SBP and DBP with the RFR model against the reference in all
  patients were −0.04 ± 6.11 and 0.11 ± 3.62 mmHg, respectively, which
  complied with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation
  and the British Hypertension Society (Grade A) standards. Conclusion: The
  results indicated that the utilization of ECG and PPG signals has the
  potential to enable cuff-less and continuous BP estimation in an indirect way
  for patients with arrhythmias.%

    Blood pressure is an important vital sign of the human body. It is
  generally monitored using intravenous or cuff-based devices, both of which
  have their own drawbacks. Continuous and non-invasive blood pressure has
  significant clinical value however the measurement devices are generally
  costly and complicated to setup and operate especially in home-based
  environment. This paper investigates state of the art techniques that utilise
  one or more photoplethysmographs (PPG) to produce a device that continuously
  and non-invasively monitors a patient's blood pressure. Three different
  estimation methodologies are reviewed and compared in this paper.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The pulse arrival time (PAT), the difference between the R-peak time of
  electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and the systolic peak of photoplethysmography
  (PPG) signal, is an indicator that enables noninvasive and continuous blood
  pressure estimation. However, it is difficult to accurately measure PAT from
  ECG and PPG signals because they have inconsistent shapes owing to
  patient-specific physical characteristics, pathological conditions, and
  movements. Accordingly, complex preprocessing is required to estimate blood
  pressure based on PAT. In this paper, as an alternative solution, we propose
  a noninvasive continuous algorithm using the difference between ECG and PPG
  as a new feature that can include PAT information. The proposed algorithm is
  a deep CNN–LSTM-based multitasking machine learning model that outputs
  simultaneous prediction results of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood
  pressures (DBP). We used a total of 48 patients on the PhysioNet website by
  splitting them into 38 patients for training and 10 patients for testing. The
  prediction accuracies of SBP and DBP were 0.0 ± 1.6 mmHg and 0.2 ±
  1.3 mmHg, respectively. Even though the proposed model was assessed with
  only 10 patients, this result was satisfied with three guidelines, which are
  the BHS, AAMI, and IEEE standards for blood pressure measurement devices.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    A novel method for the continual, cuff-less estimation of the systolic
  blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values based on
  signal complexity analysis of the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and the
  electrocardiogram (ECG) is reported. The proposed framework estimates the
  blood pressure (BP) values obtained from signals generated from 14 volunteers
  subjected to a series of exercise routines. Herein, the physiological signals
  were first pre-processed, followed by the extraction of complexity features
  from both the PPG and ECG. Subsequently the complexity features were used in
  regression models (artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine
  (SVM) and LASSO) to predict the BP. The performance of the approach was
  evaluated by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE) and the standard
  deviation (STD) of the predicted results and compared with the
  recommendations made by the British Hypertension Society (BHS) and
  Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). Complexity
  features from the ECG and PPG were investigated independently, along with the
  combined dataset. It was observed that the complexity features obtained from
  the combination of ECG and PPG signals resulted to an improved estimation
  accuracy for the BP. The most accurate DBP result of 5.15 ± 6.46 mmHg was
  obtained from ANN model, and SVM generated the most accurate prediction for
  the SBP which was estimated as 7.33 ± 9.53 mmHg. Results for DBP fall within
  recommended performance of the BHS but SBP is outside the range. Although
  initial results are promising, further improvements are required before the
  potential of this approach is fully realised.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Accurate automatic noninvasive assessment of blood pressure (BP) presents a
  challenge due to conditions like arrhythmias, obesity, and postural changes
  that tend to obfuscate arterial amplitude pulsations sensed by the cuff.
  Researchers tried to overcome this challenge by analyzing oscillometric
  pulses with the aid of a higher fidelity signalthe electrocardiogram (ECG).
  Moreover, pulse transit time (PTT) was employed to provide an additional
  method for BP estimation. However, these methods were not fully developed,
  suitably integrated, or tested. To address these issues, we present a novel
  method whereby ECG-assisted oscillometric and PTT (measured between ECG
  R-peaks and maximum slope of arterial pulse peaks) analyses are seamlessly
  integrated into the oscillometric BP measurement paradigm. The method
  bolsters oscillometric analysis (amplitude modulation) with more reliable ECG
  R-peaks provides a complementary measure with PTT analysis (temporal
  modulation) and fuses this information for robust BP estimation. We have
  integrated this technology into a prototype that comprises a BP cuff with an
  embedded conductive fabric ECG electrode, associated hardware, and
  algorithms. A pilot study has been undertaken on ten healthy subjects (150
  recordings) to validate the performance of our prototype against United
  States Food and Drug Administration approved Omron oscillometric monitor
  (HEM-790IT). Our prototype achieves mean absolute difference of less than 5
  mmHg and grade A as per the British Hypertension Society protocol for
  estimating BP, with the reference Omron monitor. © 2011 IEEE.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    A new all optical method for long term and continuous blood pressure
  measurement and monitoring without using cuffs is proposed by using
  Ballistocardiography (BCG) and Photoplethysmograph (PPG). Based on BCG signal
  and PPG signal, a time delay between these two signals is obtained to
  calculate both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure via
  linear regression analysis. The fabricated noninvasive blood pressure
  monitoring device consists of a fiber sensor mat to measure BCG signal and a
  SpO2 sensor to measure PPG signal. A commercial digital oscillometric blood
  pressure meter is used to obtain reference values and for calibration. It has
  been found that by comparing with the reference device, our prototype has
  typical means and standard deviations of 9+/-5.6mmHg for systolic blood
  pressure, 1.8+/-1.3mmHg for diastolic blood pressure and 0.6+/-0.9bpm for
  pulse rate, respectively. If the fiber optic SpO2 probe is used, this new all
  fiber cuffless noninvasive blood pressure monitoring device will truly be a
  MRI safe blood pressure measurement and monitoring device. © 2013 IEEE.%

    Measurement of blood volumetric changes in human body by
  photoplethysmographic sensors is used in present study. Objective is to
  measured different parameters that are heart rate, respiratory rate, BP. PPG
  signal is acquired by PPG sensor, microcontroller and RS 232. The acquired
  PPG signal is displayed in MATLAB. Frequency domain analysis of PPG signal
  shows a two peaks first at around 0.25 to 0.35 Hz and second at around 1 to
  1.5 Hz. FFT at 1Hz relates to 60 BPM and FFT at 0.25 Hz relates to 15
  respiratory cycles per minute. For BP Measurement, the pulse height of PPG is
  proportional to the difference between the systolic and the diastolic
  pressure in the arteries. The standard blood pressure monitoring instrument
  is used to calculate correlation coefficient. The arterial blood pressure is
  calculated based on these coefficients. PPG signal is used to detect blood
  pressure pulsations in a finger and achieved an accuracy of (0.8 ± 7) mmHg
  and (0.9 ± 6) mmHg for systolic and diastolic pressure, respectively. The
  developed PPG based method can be used as a noninvasive alternative to the
  conventional occluding-cuff approaches for long-term and continuous
  monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate.%

    This paper presents a new method for obtaining the blood pressure readings
  noninvasively with telemedicine application. Through the pulse transit time
  technique, the systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures can be predicted
  using the time interval between the electrocardiogram (ECG) and
  photoplethysmography (PPG). The data can then be relayed to the Internet for
  analysis and viewing. The wireless application protocol (WAP) is used for
  displaying the information on portable wireless devices. The subjects'

    Pulse transit time (PTT) has attracted much interest for cuffless blood
  pressure (BP) measurement. However, its limited accuracy is one of the main
  problems preventing its widespread acceptance. Arterial BP oscillates mainly
  at high frequency (HF) because of respiratory activity, and at low frequency
  (LF) because of vasomotor tone. Prior studies suggested that PTT can track BP
  variation in HF range, but was inadequate to follow the LF variation, which
  is probably the main reason for its unsatisfactory accuracy. This paper
  presents a new indicator, the photoplethysmogram intensity ratio (PIR), which
  can be affected by changes in the arterial diameter, and, thus, trace the LF
  variation of BP. Spectral analysis of BP, PTT, PIR, and respiratory signal
  confirmed that PTT was related to BP in HF at the respiratory frequency,
  while PIR was associated with BP in LF range. We, therefore, develop a novel
  BP estimation algorithm by using both PTT and PIR. The proposed algorithm was
  validated on 27 healthy subjects with continuous Finapres BP as reference.
  The results showed that the mean ± standard deviation (SD) for the estimated
  systolic, diastolic, and mean BP with the proposed method against reference
  were -0.37 ± 5.21, -0.08 ± 4.06, -0.18 ± 4.13 mmHg, and mean absolute
  difference (MAD) were 4.09, 3.18, 3.18 mmHg, respectively. Furthermore, the
  proposed method outperformed the two most cited PTT algorithms for about 2
  mmHg in SD and MAD. These results demonstrated that the proposed BP model
  using PIR and PTT can estimate continuous BP with improved accuracy.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Noninvasive measurement of blood pressure by optical methods receives
  considerable interest, but the complexity of the measurement and the
  difficulty of adjusting parameters restrict applications. We develop a method
  for estimating the systolic and diastolic blood pressure using a single-point
  optical recording of a photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal. The estimation is
  data-driven, we use automated machine learning algorithms instead of
  mathematical models. Combining supervised learning with a discrete wavelet
  transform, the method is insensitive to minor irregularities in the PPG
  waveform, hence both pulse oximeters and smartphone cameras can record the
  signal. We evaluate the accuracy of the estimation on 78 samples from 65
  subjects (40 male, 25 female, age 29±7) with no history of cardiovascular
  disease. The estimate for systolic blood pressure has a mean error 4.9±4.9
  mm Hg, and 4.3±3.7 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure when using the
  oximeter-obtained PPG. The same values are 5.1±4.3 mm Hg and 4.6±4.3 mm Hg
  when using the phone-obtained PPG, comparing with A&D UA-767PBT result as
  gold standard. The simplicity of the method encourages ambulatory
  measurement, and given the ease of sharing the measured data, we expect a
  shift to data-oriented approaches deriving insight from ubiquitous mobile
  devices that will yield more accurate machine learning models in monitoring
  blood pressure.%

    Recently a few methods have been proposed in the literature for
  non-invasive cuff-less estimation of systolic and diastolic blood pressures.
  One of the most prominent methods is to use the Pulse Transit Time (PTT).
  Although it is proven that PTT has a strong correlation with the systolic and
  diastolic blood pressures, this relation is highly dependent to each
  individuals physiological properties. Therefore, it requires per person
  calibration for accurate and reliable blood pressure estimation from PTT,
  which is a big drawback. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, a novel
  method is proposed for accurate and reliable estimation of blood pressure
  that is calibration-free. This goal is accomplished by extraction of several
  physiological parameters from Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal as well as
  utilizing signal processing and machine learning algorithms. The results show
  that the accuracy of the proposed method achieves grade B for the estimation
  of the diastolic blood pressure and grade C for the estimation of the mean
  arterial pressure under the standard British Hypertension Society (BHS)
  protocol.%

    Considering the existing issues of traditional blood pressure (BP)
  measurement methods and non-invasive continuous BP measurement techniques,
  this study aims to establish the systolic BP and diastolic BP estimation
  models based on machine learning using pulse transit time and characteristics
  of pulse waveform. In the process of model construction, the mean impact
  value method was introduced to investigate the impact of each feature on the
  models and the genetic algorithm was introduced to implement parameter
  optimization. The experimental results showed that the proposed models could
  effectively describe the nonlinear relationship between the features and BP
  and had higher accuracy than the traditional methods with the error of 3.27
  ± 5.52 mmHg for systolic BP and 1.16 ± 1.97 mmHg for diastolic BP.
  Moreover, the estimation errors met the requirements of the Advancement of
  Medical Instrumentation and British Hypertension Society criteria. In
  conclusion, this study was helpful in promoting the practical application of
  methods for non-invasive continuous BP estimation models.%

    Background Modern clinical environments are laden with technology devices
  continuously gathering physiological data from patients. This is especially
  true in critical care environments, where life-saving decisions may have to
  be made on the basis of signals from monitoring devices. Hemodynamic
  monitoring is essential in dialysis, surgery, and in critically ill patients.
  For the most severe patients, blood pressure is normally assessed through a
  catheter, which is an invasive procedure that may result in adverse effects.
  Blood pressure can also be monitored noninvasively through different methods
  and these data can be used for the continuous assessment of pressure using
  machine learning methods. Previous studies have found pulse transit time to
  be related to blood pressure. In this short paper, we propose to study the
  feasibility of implementing a data-driven model based on restricted Boltzmann
  machine artificial neural networks, delivering a first proof of concept for
  the validity and viability of a method for blood pressure prediction based on
  these models. Summary and Key Messages For the most severe patients (e.g.,
  dialysis, surgery, and the critically ill), blood pressure is normally
  assessed through invasive catheters. Alternatively, noninvasive methods have
  also been developed for its monitorization. Data obtained from noninvasive
  measurements can be used for the continuous assessment of pressure using
  machine learning methods. In this study, a restricted Boltzmann machine
  artificial neural network is used to present a first proof of concept for the
  validity and viability of a method for blood pressure prediction.%

    Development and evaluation of automated decision support systems requires

  will include 100 patient records, each typically containing between 24 and 48
  hours of continuous data recorded from patient monitors in the medical,
  surgical, and cardiac intensive care units of Boston's Beth Israel Hospital.
  Each record will be accompanied by detailed clinical data derived from the
