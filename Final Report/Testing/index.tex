\section{Testing}
Describe your Test Plan - how the program or system
was verified. Put the actual test results in an Appendix if they are repetitive but relevant. Detailed test data
may be omitted from the report if not relevant,
however an accurate summary of tests should be
included in the Report itself. Sometimes non-working
designs are described in project reports as though
they work, when in reality they don't, or only partially
work. Therefore a precise description of what works
and how this has been established is important.
Examiners may try to compile, use, or test
deliverables themselves (even after your report is
submitted), and your report should accurately reflect
the state of the project.\\ \newline \noindent This section is normally useful for software or
hardware deliverables and less relevant in analytical
projects.
