\section{Appendix}
The appendices contain information
that is peripheral to the main body of the report.
Information typically included are things like
program listings, complex circuit diagrams,
tables, proofs, graphs or any other material
which would break up the theme of the text if it
appeared in situ. Large program listings may be
submitted with the report although it is
preferable either to provide them on CD, or to
cite details of a suitable accessible cloud
repository containing the material. Where CDs
are used you must prepare two CDs, one for each
paper copy of the report.\\ \newline \noindent Please use 
appendices as necessary for material that
is tangentially relevant, or necessary to preserve
project value, but that you do not expect Examiners to
read. Note that software projects with significant code
should normally provide electronic versions of the
code on USB stick, CDROM, or cloud repository. In
that case the Appendix should state where the code
may be found. \textbf{The Appendix should normally
include, or refer to, all the technical details needed
for another user to continue code development}.
Typical items that should not be in the main report,
but should (possibly - since Appendices are not
normally read this is a matter of judgement) be in
appendices:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Source code. Note that code (if long) should
    also be available in some electronic form, e.g. a github repository, CD, or USB 
    stick. Software
    projects must provide access to the source
    code in some form. The Appendix will then
    reference this.
    \item Test data sets (again, for large volumes of
    data an electronic form would be more
    appropriate). The report itself will contain
    concise summaries of the test data in a
    human readable form.
    \item Raw results. Tables of results in unreadable
    form should not be put in the main report, but
    if needed may be put in an Appendix.
    \item Related material possibly but not directly
    relevant to the project work. E.g. manuals of
    test equipment used. (There is no
    requirement to include such, but in some
    cases, where they have some tangential
    relevance, it might be appropriate)
\end{itemize}
