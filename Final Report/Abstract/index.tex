\section*{Abstract}
The motivation of this project is the early prediction and prevention of hypertension, or high blood pressure, using 24-hour ambulatory monitoring methods. The currently recognised methods are split into 
two categories: invasive and cuffed non-invasive. Both methods are not feasible for ambulatory monitoring as they either require to be measured in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) or are 
too uncomfortable to be measured for long periods of time respectively. Hence, this provides the motivation to develop a non-invasive, cuffless method to estimate ambulatory blood pressure.\\ \newline \noindent For this project, Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure values are estimated from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals using a Transformer Encoder Artificial Neural Network. 
The performance of this architecture is compared alongside four other architectures which have been previously used for cuffless estimation of blood pressure values. \\ \newline \noindent This report includes a literature survey of all existing estimation methods. In addition, the analysis, design, testing and results of the proposed method are discussed. My proposed model achieves a mean absolute error of 12.740 mmHg for Systolic BP and 5.4763 mmHg for Diastolic BP respectively. 
Overall, the proposed method obtains an acceptable accuracy which can be improved in the future with further testing.
