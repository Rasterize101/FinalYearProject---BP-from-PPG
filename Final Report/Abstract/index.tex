\section*{Final Report Plagiarism Statement}
I affirm that I have submitted, or will submit, an electronic copy of 
my final year project report to the provided EEE link.\\ \newline \noindent I affirm 
that I have provided explicit references for all the material in my Final Report that 
is not authored by me, but is represented as my own work.

\newpage


\section*{Abstract}
The abstract should (very concisely) summarise the
topic, content and conclusions of the project.
Abstracts can vary in length from 50 words up to at
most 200 words. They are more concise than
executive summaries. \\ \newline \noindent The abstract is a very brief summary of
the report's contents. It should be about half a
page long. Somebody unfamiliar with your
project should have a good idea of what it's
about having read the abstract alone and will
know whether it will be of interest to them.
