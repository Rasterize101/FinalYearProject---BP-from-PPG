   abstract = {The continuous systolic and diastolic pressure have great medical value, especially for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases detection. Beside the inconvenience of cuff based blood pressure (BP) measurement devices, the lack of widely accepted accurate measurements and calibration, the BP portable devices are even less attractive. The pulse transit time (PTT) is related to arterial stiffness and can be used to estimate systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Considering the complex multivariate physiological processes in human body, depending on only PTT doesn't give acceptable accuracy. This study extends the pulse transit time (PTT) based cuff less BP measurement method to include the heart rate (HR) as an additional information. A new model based on linear regression is proposed that include the HR to measure the BP. PTT only BP and the proposed PTT and HR based BP measurement models are tested using MIMIC database. Using model including linear regression and curve fitting, it was shown that the proposed model reduced the BP root mean square error (RMSE) for SBP from 9.6 to 7.1 and for DBP from 4.2 to 3.1 compared to conventional PTT only based methods.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop an intensive care unit research database applying automated techniques to aggregate high-resolution diagnostic and therapeutic data from a large, diverse population of adult intensive care unit patients. This freely available database is intended to support epidemiologic research in critical care medicine and serve as a resource to evaluate new clinical decision support and monitoring algorithms. DESIGN: Data collection and retrospective analysis. SETTING: All adult intensive care units (medical intensive care unit, surgical intensive care unit, cardiac care unit, cardiac surgery recovery unit) at a tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Adult patients admitted to intensive care units between 2001 and 2007. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II) database consists of 25,328 intensive care unit stays. The investigators collected detailed information about intensive care unit patient stays, including laboratory data, therapeutic intervention profiles such as vasoactive medication drip rates and ventilator settings, nursing progress notes, discharge summaries, radiology reports, provider order entry data, International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, and, for a subset of patients, high-resolution vital sign trends and waveforms. Data were automatically deidentified to comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards and integrated with relational database software to create electronic intensive care unit records for each patient stay. The data were made freely available in February 2010 through the Internet along with a detailed user's guide and an assortment of data processing tools. The overall hospital mortality rate was 11.7\%, which varied by critical care unit. The median intensive care unit length of stay was 2.2 days (interquartile range, 1.1-4.4 days). According to the primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, the following disease categories each comprised at least 5\% of the case records: diseases of the circulatory system (39.1\%); trauma (10.2\%); diseases of the digestive system (9.7\%); pulmonary diseases (9.0\%); infectious diseases (7.0\%); and neoplasms (6.8\%). CONCLUSIONS: MIMIC-II documents a diverse and very large population of intensive care unit patient stays and contains comprehensive and detailed clinical data, including physiological waveforms and minute-by-minute trends for a subset of records. It establishes a new public-access resource for critical care research, supporting a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule development, and electronic tool development.

@article{Fujita2019,
   abstract = {This paper proposes a cuFF-less systolic blood pressure (SBP) estimation method using partial least-squares (PLS) regression. Level-crossing features (LCFs) were used in this method, which were extracted from the contour lines arbitrarily drawn on the second-derivative photoplethysmography waveform. Unlike conventional height ratio features (HRFs), which are extracted on the basis of the peaks in the waveform, LCFs can be reliably extracted even if there are missing peaks in the waveform. However, the features extracted from adjacent contour lines show similar trends; thus, there is a strong correlation between the features, which leads to multicollinearity when conventional multiple regression analysis (MRA) is used. Hence, we developed a multivariate estimation method based on PLS regression to address this issue and estimate the SBP on the basis of the LCFs. Two-hundred-and-sixty-five subjects (95 males and 170 females [(Mean ± Standard Deviation) SBP: 133.1 ± 18.4 mmHg; age: 62.8 ± 16.8 years] participated in the experiments. Of the total number of subjects, 180 were considered as learning data, while 85 were considered as testing data. The values of the correlation coefficient between the measured and estimated values were found to be 0.78 for the proposed method (LCFs + PLS), 0.58 for comparison method 1 (HRFs + MRA), and 0.62 for comparison method 2 (HRFs + MRA). The proposed method was therefore found to demonstrate the highest accuracy among the three methods being compared.},
