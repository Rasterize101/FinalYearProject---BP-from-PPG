\section{Introduction}
This is one of the most important
components of the report. It should begin with a
clear statement of what the project is about so
that the nature and scope of the project can be
understood by a lay reader. Further information can be found in the separate
Final Report Structure and Contents document.\\ \newline \noindent The introduction should set the scene and give a high-level problem statement/specification, so that after
reading the introduction the reader understands
roughly what the problem is and what you intend to
do about it. Is the idea to write software, or develop
an algorithm, or produce hardware, or something
else?
You should then highlight and summarise the most
interesting or important questions or problems that
your project addresses, and the broader context in
which those questions or problems are situated.
Finally, you must briefly introduce the structure of
report (what you will cover in which chapters and how
these relate to each other). You don't need to go into
any detail, the aim is to make sure the reader has an
idea about what will be discussed and in what order.
